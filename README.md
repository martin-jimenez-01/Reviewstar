# Reviewstar
## Overview
Reviewstar is a platform designed to help pinpoint problem areas in American Airline airports

## How we made it happen 
We split up into two subteams: front end and back end. The back end team focused on the web-scrapping and processing that data via sentiment analyis to determine the most common complaints per airport. Front end team used HTML, CSS< and Javascript to create the web app that displays our findings

## How to run 
Launch `index.html` with your browse. Once there, select a "Location" from the dropdown. The dropdown menu is ordered by Locations suffering the worst reviews. Each summary will display the top issue of said location and offer a download link to all the raw reviews that were used to determine the severity of this location's reviews.
