"I live in Westchester County, NY, and regularly travel from Westchester County Airport HPN, to different parts of the USA.I find that American Airlines, with it's extensive availability of airports around the country, provides me with easy access to wherever my destination may be, and fares are always very reasonably priced.I highly recommend this airline."
"I am not a fan of American Airlines at all.  They are inconsistent and often cancel and delay flights and say it is ""weather related"" when, if you google where your incoming or connecting flight is coming from, it'll be clear skies and no delay.  I dislike the dishonesty and they do not go out of their way to provide you with anything if they do this to you.  Like hotels or food.  This is why they say it's weather, so they don't have to and aren't required. In addition to this, they've lost my bags before and on this last trip through Charlotte connecting from Cancun, they lost three of our five bags (we were traveling in a huge family group) and they didn't make it onto our plane. This left us without our bags when we returned to the airport at home later.  We had a two-hour layover and the plane was delayed for an hour at the gate from pushing off bc there was a ""maintenance issue"" so we had 3 hours for our bags to make it onto the plane.  No excuses for their poor performance.  They just don't care.  Sometimes I get where I need to go with no issue with AA.  But it's very rare - I've come more to expect issues than an easy travel day. I'll continue to be loyal and pay more to fly Delta bc they consistently do a better job overall."
"Would give negative stars if possible. This airline is incapable of on time travel. They offer almost no communication about the extent of delays. When they do communication, they are NEVER accurate. You are better off walking or swimming to your destination than flying with American. My flight from Daytona to Charlotte (1485) was delayed ""15 minutes"". Well, that 15 minutes turned into NINE HOURS! In the end they postponed the flight until the following day. Rude and uncaring people at the gate just added insult to injury. Do yourself a favor: Fly Delta."
"This is a good American Airlines Terminal.  The staff were very helpful and efficient.   I had a very comfortable flight, my only drawback was the large crowd at such a small boarding gate.  Overall this was a good experience."
Nice place for eat !!!!All kind of  Restaurant ! Food is good Highly recommend it ! Very spacious place stop and relax for a while
"I mentioned in previous posts that I travel 75% of the year. My go-to airline is AA. I have only had six snags this year, mostly weather-related, with two mechanical delays and one of the weather issues being overnight. They covered our room and got us out the following day. No fault of the airline as the weather is unpredictable. Not a bad record for the year if you ask me. I get great service, and I'm always treated right by the staff. The first-class meals are rather decent. I'm headed home from BWI, connected in CLT, and at last in route to SAT."
"CHS at the Boarding gate and the person who helped me out for Chek in and pritning board pass on October 6th 2022- she was there while boarding -highly helpful, nice, wonderful people...at the Gate...Flight attendants were nice - i did not write down their names...but i did write down for CLT to MCO - Miss Heather and brother Mr. Chris i believe was at the fag end this one is AA 1573....i wanted to appreciate both of them and the gate personnel at CHS, SC on October 7th 2022"
"Super nice folks from CLT to Las Vegas, Nevada on August 7th 2019... even though my Yelp and Yelp  notifications are not working in mobile properly. i should nevyer forget the good Karma they do ...Ms. Carla was super great and She was doing non-stop - weather was extremely bad- people were worried it was going up and down like a roller coaster- she was trying to serve they asked everyone to sit down, it was tough for her to reach- she had to take too much Risk -such kind of true example Air Hostess should be recognized world over- this is AA 627 from Charlotte to Las Vegas- American Airlines - Boarding pass- Main cabin - i got the ticket issues 06 auguust 2019 - but flew on Wednesday i need to send a nice note for the American airlines baggage claim"
Connecting flight from Punta Cana to CLT to LGA. I'm writing this review because I had a horrible encounter with one of the attendants at gate D5 at CLT on 1/20/23. Her attitude was rude and nasty plus she wasn't understanding. I didn't get her name but she was an older lady with glasses checking people in. Liz ( I believe that was her name) on the other hand decided to help me and my boyfriend and was super understanding and kind. She got us seated on the flight and even came on the plane to get us seats that were closer to the front. Some of you should be more like LIZ! Not sure she'll ever see this but thank you!
"I had a horrible experience with the American Airlines ticketing agent in Nashville. She made absolutely no effort to help me, but seemed to take great pleasure in making things more difficult than they needed to be. I believe her name was something like Andrea Tousssian, but she turned her name tag over before I could verify."
"Not the cleanest airline in the world, thats for sure. But seems like the maintenance staff is super quick in getting on the plane upon arrival, to do clean up. Just not sure if their on point with the actual cleaning. In between the sears and surrounding areas were dirty and dusty. Please, don't you know it's COVID out here?!? I take several flights with United each year and the lack of cleanliness is the same. The charging an outlets are good though."

"First time flying American and it will be my last.I had a flight from Jacksonville NC to Charlotte.  It was unfortunately delayed which we were notified well prior to arriving at the airport.  Once we arrived I asked the rep at the gate repeatedly if we would make our connecting flight from Charlotte to Buffalo and the answer was always yes.  While in the air the pilot made an announcement that to avoid bad weather an additional 20 minutes would be added to our flight.  When we landed I ran from one end of the airport to another.  I arrived at the gate and the monitor stated ""Gate Closed"" but I saw the airplane still parked and connected to the tunnel.  I asked the rep at the gate to open the door and let us on the plane.  She fumbled around without our boarding passes for multiple minutes.  By the time she opened the door the tunnel was disconnected from the airplane and the plane's door was closed.  I was outraged.  Had our boarding passes not be analyzed my family would've been on that flight.  Also, the airline has a manifest of who is supposed to be on the airplane.  You knew our flight was delayed.  You knew when we were landing.  You couldn't give us some time to hop on this flight?  We were told ""only Dallas can make the authorization to deeply a flight"".  Well did someone call Dallas to let them know the situation?  Solutions offered to my family - take a taxi to a hotel.  YOU HAD OUR CAR SEATS.  Take an Uber.  WE WERE A 10 HOUR DRIVE AWAY FROM HOME. Rent a car - ALL THE CAR RENTAL PLACES WERE CLOSED.  Here are some food vouchers.  RESTURANTS - ALSO CLOSED!.  Then we were told to take a flight to Pittsburgh.  While waiting in line we booked a hotel room.  That flight got cancelled.  No $ back for the room.  My family consisting of a one year old and a four month old slept on the floor of the Charlotte airport.  No stroller, no food, nothing.  The lack of compassion my family received was disgusting.  $125 flight voucher won't cut it.  We want our $ money back with compensation!"
"Used to be a great airline but hopefully it will return as soon as some realities are addressed.Emphasis if on selling the seat and collecting the revenue and being able to actually provide an on time flight are of no consideration.We booked this flight back in April so my wife could fly up to Pittsburgh for her Granddaughters HS graduation party.Flight up on June 15  was not bad but flight back on June 22 was a nightmare not suitable for prime time.Her departure time for the Pittsburgh to Charlotte segment was a little after 2pm with an ETA around 3;30pm. She got to the airport between 11am and 11:30am and checked and went to her concourse and found a nice restaurant for lunch.At 12:30 pm she texted me that the flight was delayed by 1 hour and 45 minutes..  Over the course of the afternoon, the departure time kept being pushed back and a little after 4pm, it was announced that the plane was just then pushing back from the gate in Charlotte NC to fly to PittsburghPlane landed and they could not refuel and service the plane due to a ground stop due to weather.Plane finally took off around 6:30 pm and landed in Charlotte at 7:50 pm. I was in the Cell Phone lot 5 minutes away from the arrival area when she called and I picked her up at 8:30pm In other words, almost 5 hours late.Now for the reality check.  Seats were sold without regard to either personnel or equipment issues. If there are issues with the later, then seats should not have been sold.  Supply must equal demand or you end up with poor service.Don't know if it is the case, but airlines make the most profit if the plane is totally full. I do know that there were additional flights from Pittsburgh to Charlotte around 4 pm and if they were not full, this delay insured that the flight that did leave was completely full.If it is a Personnel issue, eliminate or adjust the flight schedule to match the available pilots and flight crews.  AA and other carriers should face the reality that the service should not be compromised to maximize profitability.I was looking at AA as a carrier for a trip to San Diego but must look at my options. Not sure any of the other carriers will be any better but since I am semi-retired and have always want to take a transcontinental train ride, may be time to investigate that."
Our flight out of SJU was delayed due to bad weather in the Northeast. Since we had a short layover in CLT we ended up missing our connecting flight. We tried to run from Terminal B to Terminal E but it was futile. The AA staff at the gate told us they could put us on stand by on the next flight. When they realized we had a 4 year old they did their magic and got us on that flight. I have to admit I was upset at missing the connection but their efforts to accommodate us went above and beyond and I have to thank them for that.
"I hate American Airlines. I avoid flying on them whenever possible, but sometimes I just have to for work. Apart from the fact that they were superwoke superNazis during the ""pandemic"", they are incredibly inept at managing their business. Get people on the damned plane, take off, fly to the destination, land, and get people off the damned plane. They absolutely suck at three of those. They're given dictatorial powers on the damned plane, but they can't get people on and seated, they suck at taking off on time, and they suck at deplaning. Every time I fly AA, I remember anew why I hate them with a blue hot passion."
"I am on flight AA1815 traveling from Charlotte to DCA. I was asleep and unaware that my seat was in the back position. The stewardess named Lisa tapped me to get my attention. As I pushed the button to put the seat upright I put my hood back on my head to go back to sleep, she then took her nails and pushed me hard to grab my attention again. I am already tired and disoriented from a recent surgery so I'm really not understanding why her hostility is at an all time high for me. I expressed that I tried to put the seat up and it wouldn't work. And she started to become irate as if I had said or done something wrong. I am beyond disappointed in her behavior and I am super disgusted at how she treated me. I will not be flying American any time soon. I believe I was very calm in this reaction because as a police officer, I don't take people putting their hands on me lightly. She def needs some training in how to handle customers. I could have been deaf, hard of hearing and all that. She wasn't using the proper techniques to handle a customer with care nor did she ask politely. My sister in law is deaf, she would have gotten a rude awakening if it were her and not me.  Because if I were anyone else, and didn't have anything to lose, we both would have been the next social media sensation."
"I've noticed from reading reviews that so many only take to writing them when they're frustrated because something didn't go right... I write them regardless, both ways, good or bad to provide honest feedback.When it comes to American Airlines, I always appreciate how friendly (yes, they really are friendly) the staff are.  I've experienced some with short tempers or who didn't wake up on the good side of the bed, but the overall majority aren't like this.  I've called and received great service over the phone, via their policies and I can honestly say I've appreciated the service from AA employees way more than from SW or Spirit.Let me also add that I've been seriously delayed due to equipment issues, lack of planes, the domino effect of having a flight later in the day and there were delays that racked up throughout the day.  Recently, a month ago, due to delays, it took me twice as long to fly than it would have if I had driven and that was each way in a round trip... yes, both legs of this trip a couple days apart had serious delays... But the staff were friendly, helpful, accommodating, etc."
"Of course you have to show your ID card when checking . I immediately when through check point, when I realized the cashier didn't return my military dependent ID card! Thankfully, I had another form of ID. When I got to my gate for flight AA5404, if asked the clerk at the gate if she could check see if my Id card at the  counter, her reply to me was I need to go back to the ticket counter to check! She said she unable to call to see if it was there. Now, mind you everyone have an electron device but was able to assist me! I went to another and was told the same thing...My flight boards in 40 minutes, I will not make it to the counter, then security before my flight leave!!! Horrible Customer service. Especially, when my flight was delayed until the next day. Please, provide better assist with customers needs! Please provide feedback at sguil38202@yahoo.com"
"DEPLORABLE CUSTOMER SERVICEAmerican Airlines cancels my flight and left me stranded. To get to my business appointment  as scheduled, I was left to find my  own way from Charlotte to Los Angeles. That cost me an additional $964.60 on another airline (Delta). It's therefore a reasonable expectation, that American Airline fully reimburse  the additional cost.  A Ms. Dulce Lagos, American Airlines Customer Service rep., credited 328.76, with an email blaming bad weather and also saying American Airlines does not reimburse.  My questions are:1) American Airline cancelled my flight, so should I have just ignored the        responsibility of my business meeting and wait for the airline to reschedule my flight another day that's convenient for them, or should I make other arrangements?2) American Airlines suggest that passengers purchase insurance to cover ticket cost, if they are unable to make the flight, Shouldn't it then be expected that the airline would have insurance to cover passengers cost when the airlines cancels a flight?3) If a passenger misses a flight because bad weather delayed his/her transport to the airport, American Airline offers no understanding or compassion. It's the passenger's loss. The Airline cares not how far you had to travelWhy then are passengers to accept the airline's report of bad weather for cancelled flights, without compensation for the passengers time and or money spent?. Ms. Dulce Lagos, American Airline Customer Service rep. unsatisfactorily  replied to my complaint.  below is her mail and my response.--------Dear Mr. Anderson:Thank you for your reply. Your correspondence sent directly to Customer Relations will also be addressed here. My records confirm flight 1674, operated by American Airlines, departing June 2, 2022, from Charlotte, NC to Los Angeles, CA was canceled due to weather. I can certainly understand your confusion, given that you traveled on Delta Airlines. I'm happy to explain a bit about this as there are several different weather scenarios that can impact flights when the weather seems fine or other flights are operating, including but not limited to:Weather the previous dayWeather at a hub that prevented our planes or crew members from being on timeAir traffic congestion caused by previous weather-related eventsCrew members reaching their maximum number of work hours due to a weather-related delay or cancellationTo help alleviate congestion, Air Traffic Control may require some flights to be canceled. While our goal is to minimize the inconvenience to our customers, getting our operation back on schedule takes time. Again, I sincerely regret for any disruptions you encountered. Since these disruptions are outside of our control, we would not reimburse the out-of-pocket expense for the ticket purchased on Delta Airlines. Still, I sincerely regret the inconvenience you've experienced.My records also confirm a refund was processed June 22nd back to the original form of payment, a Visa card ending in 9585 in the amount of $328.86. Although we recognize that we may not always agree upon a resolution, we do our best to be supportive as advocates for our customers. Rest assured, we value your feedback and appreciate the opportunity to improve in the future. We look forward to restoring and rebuilding your confidence.Mr. Anderson we are grateful for your AAdvantage® loyalty and hope to have the opportunity to rebuild your trust in us. It would be our pleasure to welcome you on board an American Airlines flight again in the future.Sincerely,Dulce Lagos-----Ms LagosWhile I appreciate the refund of  $328.86,   your American Airline flight  cancellation  cost me and additional $964.60, which should be compensated in  full.A point of irrefutable  fact,  had I missed the flight for any personal  reasons ( bad traffic on the way to the airport,  rain delayed transport or illness)  American Airlines would not  refund or credit my flight.  If I could get through the 3-8 hour hold time to talk with a a customer service representative I would be told NO.To protect against this, American Airline offers  Protection Insurance, at a cost, to  customers.  Without this  purchase, it is  the customer's loss and American Airlines gain.   Conversely,  it  is expected that American Airline have insurance to  cover their mishap that inconveniences customers.Secondly,  though customers should understand and accept how bad weather affects flights, American Airlines does not accept or understand  bad weather affecting  a customer's transport to the airport. However,  my  flight was cancelled not delayed  and American Airlines offered no option for  June 2,  and I had a deadline to meet.   Should I have then missed my deadline and waited for an untimely rescheduled flight  later that week, by  your Airline, or should I have  considered available options?The unavoidable option me an addition  $964.60 for which i should be fully compensated"
Boarding was easy and fast.I received a message before boarding that the plane had been cleaned and sanitized.I guess my idea of clean is different from AA.Thankfully I had wipes I brought so I could clean the pull down trays....my husband's had coffee stains on it.Most of the seats had the headrest cover pulling away from the seat.The floor had food and other debree on itThese are all easy fixes that AA needs to address.After the plane was completely loaded and doors closed the pilot informs us that maintenance has to reboot the electric system because of an annoying message.Why isn't something like this taken care of while the plane is bring prepped and cleaned instead of after everyone is onboard so that we can depart on time?Timing is everything when you are flying.
"I have been traveling with American Airlines for years now for pleasure and business.  Moving forward I do not recommend any friends or relatives to travel with AA.  In addition to that I do NOT plan on making any future plans landing in Charlotte.  This airport left a nasty taste in my mouth.  My plane was delayed for 1 hour, upon arriving to the next airport there were several people who were flying to Rome same time as us.  We arrive 2 min after our departure and the plane had already taken off.  The delay was completely out of our hands."

"If i could them less than this i would. Flying from Charlotte to Louisville and flight kept getting delayed when they knew the whole time they were gonna cancel it because it was getting too late and didn't cancel it until we were at the gate until 1AM on 1/4/23. The worker at gate C5, Tracy, couldn't be bothered to help us and messed up our travel vouchers for a taxi so we had to pay for 11 people to get a taxi to the hotel."
2 days to get out of DC to San Diego. 4 flight changes. 4 gate changes.  Overnight stay for no reason other than mismanagement and short staffing.  Last flight cancelled due to missing 1 flight attendant. Come on American....get your staff straight.
This is the first time I've flown American in years ... and now I remember why. Service and communication with their customers are both low priority for American. I wish I could give 0 stars. There is absolutely zero communication when their flights are delayed. Going on 2 hours now and they have not said one thing.
"Long lines, poor service, overcrowded planes, employees that would rather be elsewhere.  Flight was an hour late again today, took 35 minutes to retrieve luggage. I am looking for bright spots, but am finding none this year.  I suggest driving or trying Delta."
"American your dead to me! Since COVID travel had begun it's been challenging, but end of day your a business and it's about stockholders and customers. After a 14 hour delay and few answers over the Summer that was enough for me to not book again and I have not and travel often. Considering they have a current 1.5 I'm not alone. I've flown AA out of Charlotte a few times, so my 1 is an average over the years."
I wish I could give zero stars!  Customer experience is horrible and the flight attendants are not nice at all!   Get some better people!
"Way too many bad experiences!  In one trip, they lost my luggage on the way to Cincinnati and on the way back, they thought it would be fun to just hang out on the tarmac!  Save yourself a headache!"
I was traveling during the busy Christmas season many empty seats even though there were no one seated in these seats they wanted to charge me for changing to sit with my family. This airline has terrible customer service and I would never fly with them again the flight attendants were snooty and full of shit
"American Airlines ReviewOctober 9, 2021I regret having to write this letter.In Charlotte two of your employees were very rude to me. I was by the rental car room by the elevator and I needed a WiFi network. Two of your employees were talking for about 10 minutes while I was on the phone. After I got off I stood and waited patiently to ask her a question and she extended her arm and palm toward my face to indicate she did not want me to speak. I waited a little longer and asked her where the WiFi network was located. She said she was talking to somebody and refused to help me.I noticed another American Airlines employee nearby, so I asked him about the WiFi and asked him how I could report an employee's bad behavior. I followed him to C3 and spoke to Manager Michael Verley.While I was waiting for the manager the woman walked by me and called me an idiot. Some people in earshot heard her too. It was grossly inappropriate. The only thing I did was call her rude and her and her friend (also an American Airlines employee) said I was rude for interrupting them. Nonetheless, they looked like employees on the clock that would have the answer to my question.I asked the rude employee what her name was and looked at her name badge. She turned it toward her body, so I could not see it and she refused to give me her name. Therefore, I took a picture of the older African American employee. The woman she was speaking to said, ""Don't do that."" Both of them were rude, accusatory and unhelpful and both were wearing American Airlines garb a few feet from the elevator by the rental car companies.For what it's worth the employee that took me to the manager said this particularly employee has been a terrible employee over the years and should have been fired by now. He said many people have complained about her.I was told by Michael Verley that I should go to aa.com and file a complaint. I gave him my name and cell phone number since he was unable to find her after she walked through the blue door at C3 after calling me a name unprovoked. He said he would contact me if he gets her name.American Airlines ReviewOctober 9, 2021I regret having to write this letter.In Charlotte two of your employees were very rude to me.

Horrible customer service. They always gives me issues about my kennel that CDC APPROVED! Sent me son off with his dog from mobile al as unaccompanied minor.. They hounding him saying that it's not a kennel but American Airlines in Mobile gave no issue. Plus a flight attendant got on my son cell phone trying to talk to me. Completely out of line. They should have called me from the office phone!! Uneducated and unprofessional!!!I travel again with my dog and kennel for lax to Charlotte no issues. Broads in Charlotte there go issue. Uneducated flight attendants! They need training!! Badly! Lol they think is a regular backpack! Why would I put a 3k dog in a regular backpack!!! Stupid
"I'd pony up an extra $10k my next trip if it meant avoiding this airport.They cancelled our flight AT THE GATE during the ""employee strike"" as the gate agent yelled ""we have no flight attendants!"" To the angry crowd. Then customer service (2+ hour line) shoo'd us away at midnight with no voucher for hotel, refused cash compensation despite the non-weather delay. They lied and blamed the weather, said ""we know that's not true but that's what our system says, must be an error, so no refunds!"" Word must have gotten out fast because AA corporate sent me a full refund BEFORE I even requested one (never happened before!) Good choice on their part as I was ready to seek much more! SAD!"
