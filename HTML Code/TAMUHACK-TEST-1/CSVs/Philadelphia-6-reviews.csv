American Flight 5385 Crew just updated the seat of a disable couple to First Class. I thought the gesture was very nice since the woman has serious mobility issues. If the seat is empty why make her walk to the end of the plane. Very nice indeed. I had travelled with that couple on my flight down south and now we are coming back home on the same flight.My seat has plenty of leg room. Very good.
I appreciate how hard the understaffed and underpaid crew work to make these flights happen but the cramped overpriced seating and common delays make air travel just so unpleasant these days.  I don't see much difference between American and Spirit any more.
Flying is just not much fun these days... I had a flight to PA it was canceled at 2 am and I didn't know it... I had a flight from PA to O'Hare it was canceled several days before I left and then I had a flight from O'Hare to Atlanta and it was canceled about 4 hours before I was supposed to take off... all in the sane trip! They all got rescheduled with a lot of effort and time on my part... the rebooking they tried to do automatically really messed a lot of things up... so I spent lots of time on hold trying to get things worked out.It was a complete mess! Flying is just not any fun anymore unless you enjoy chaos!
"My experience with American Airlines customer service at PHL was positive. We missed our connecting flight to DEN due to our flight being diverted on account of bad weather. The airline automatically booked us on the next available flight, which left a 7a the next day. That meant overnight in Philly which we'd have to figure out on our own. We double checked and there was nothing until the next day. To make matters worse, the route was to CTL with a few hours layover there. We'd arrive in DEN at 3p. We made the long and slow moving line at the customer service area to pick up the boarding passes. When it was finally our turn, the lady who took care of us saw we had a 4 year old and decided to find us a better flight. She got us a direct flight with arrival at noon. So much better. While not the ideal situation, in the end everything work out. I have to say I was pleased with the customer service."
"Once a top airline for service and being dependable. For the last year they have been neither. Overbooked, delayed or canceled flights and poor customer service can be easily predicted. Please be careful when booking a flight out of the country. With the new return to US Covid policy there is no room for error! If your flight is canceled and a 1 day COVID test is required what then? Also where do you go, who pays? This is too much for my mind to deal with at the last minute in another country. This shakes your belief American Airlines can function at a high level.In the last 30 days two international flights returning to the US were delayed. Now the have me in full OJ Simpson mode running through the airport for my rental car and from the LAPD on the freeway!  This is exhausting for me and EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL FOR AMERICAN AIRLINES! Fly any other airline, at this point Spirit is more dependable. With Spirit, Frontier and Jet Blue possible delays are cancellations are normal and expected because of the discounted flights.When possible fly Delta!"
"American Airlines has always been my airline of choice and fly others to find out why. I fly semi weekly for many years... Ease of flight, the employees are kinder, more polite, and less restrictions & better allowances for your personal item vs paying carryon rates. Less delays for me, and overall much better experience. I just had a terrible flying experience in Fromtier Airlines and they are now charging $70-99.00 for bags that fit under your seat so that was my last time with Frontier. Thanks AA!"
Just wanted to give American Airlines a shout out! My family and I had them on our way to and from Mexico and the service was outstanding. My dad accidentally left something on our plane and they were able to retrieve it so we could come back to the airport and pick it up! I will definitely try to fly American air more often!
"This company should be named ""Abandoned Airlines"" it's a joke. Abandoned Airlines-book a flight with them to get stranded at the airport! (That can be their new slogan).They're cancelling several flights for ""weather"" when in reality it's due to a shortage of pilots since they're not paying their enough. Yet they're still booking flights to roll in money. Customer Service at this airport were clueless and the supervisor disappeared (must be in the training manual for Abandoned Airlines‍). Not only do they not give a care in the world about their passengers, they lie to everyone and try to cover up their horrible management style. ""Weather""....come on, maybe it's time to learn a customer-first approach. Had to get a driver to get home since there were no flights for a few days, oh and we weren't allowed to book sooner flights since it was with ""competitive airlines."" Southwest is 50x better I will never in my life go with this corrupted airline again."
"The only good thing about AA is the lounge at the airports. They've moved every flight I've been on and even canceled one in Florida last month in which they had my luggage put me in a cheesy hotel for the night then on a flight for 6am meaning I had to get up shower at 3am, catch a shuttle to the airport and get my plane back to CA. I'm glad I don't have anymore flights this year with them.Never again"
"The worst customer service. Employees are horrible. Will stick to Delta ONLY going forward. Cannot answer questions, rude, dismissive, argumentative. Gross conduct. I haven't flown American in a long time and now I remember why."
I hope to never fly with AA again bec it took 12 hours to get home from New Orleans yesterday.  Why we couldn't get a direct flight home (like the one we had leaving Phila. to Nola on 12/12) is beyond me.  We flew to Charlotte NC on 12/18 and were only supposed to have a 2 hr. layover but it turned into 5 hrs!  Unbelievably mobbed at our gate with travelers trying to get out of NC and to their destinations.  I will make sure I use Delta moving forward.  I've never had a bad experience with Delta in my 20+ yrs. of flying!
"I've connected through Philadelphia quite a few times over the years on American (after the USAir merger) so I'm surprised to see that I've never Yelped about it.As is generally the case these days - particularly on major U.S. airlines like United and American - flying isn't exactly pleasant. You have hostile check-in staff, gate agents, and cabin crew who are looking for ever-more creative ways to enforce rules arbitrarily and collect as much fees as possible, particularly when it comes to luggage. This means that the flying masses will try to find ever more creative ways to bring as much crap as possible on board, like on one of my recent AA flights through PHL, where someone came on board with over half a dozen large pieces of clothing in her hands, in addition to a tablet, tablet power cord, and bag of food dangling all over the place. I guess that got away with the carry-on baggage limits. Said passenger then proceeded to half-a**edly stuff whatever holes were left in the overhead bins with these items, some of which fell onto the passengers below. Good times.Fortunately, if you're lucky enough to get an upgrade to First, then you might have more slightly personal space and less exposure to the masses. If I'm upgraded from my usual exit row aisle seat, then I'll opt to cocoon myself in a window seat up in First. And if you're on a regional jet flying to another Northeast destination, the tight squeeze in either cabin will be somewhat tempered by the short ride."
"Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Horrible Service, price, food and beverage, management, losing bags, ...."
"Although we reached our destination (thus the 2 stars) travel on American Airlines was brain damage.  Missed our 1st connection; flight was still there, but they closed the door as we ran/reached the gate. Re-routed us thru Charlotte where they actually held the plane for us. Still, arrived 6 hours later than paid for. Missing items from my luggage for which I was told (by recording) to file a complaint on AA.com. Trip back, paid extra to sit together; changed our seats and would not admit the error and would not sit us together. Very poor service/ ""I don't care"" attitudes prevailed. I've been an ""Advantage "" member and am an AAdvantage credit card holder. Scrapping both after this ridiculous experience. Never paid so much and the service has declined beyond belief. Very disappointed in a company I've held in such high regard for so long."
"Do not try and fly American with your pet. My pug is 24 pounds. When I arrived to check in, they would not let him fly because they said he would not turn around in his crate...while we are WATCHING him turn around in his crate. Gary , at check in, was rude, insulting, and would not listen to reason. They would not let me board the flight to my sons wedding. I have flown 6 times in the past few months with my dog on United. I thought I would try American since they have direct flights to CA from PA. Lesson learned."
"This airline will cause you to be late for connecting flights without notice. This causes travelers extra time and money that they don't care a thing about. they got the money you paid to have something done and they don't deliver on. This airline is such a disappointment in every way, with no help. Don't waste your time with them. So Sad."
"Still charging bag fees post 9/11 and being bailed out by the US government. Now they charge for seat assignments and bags. On top of that they are wildy understaffed at the various posts they have AA reps at. They don't care about customer service, if they did this business would have been claimed on Yelp."
This airline sucks. Missed two connecting flights because of their poor scheduling. Do not recommend
All group 9 had to check their bags at the door even though there was plenty of room in the overhead bins. Unacceptable attitude and no empathy for delays and then rude treatment of passengers! I'm so angry at one employee I could scream. Her attitude was unacceptable.
"Flying out of PHL today to SFO in a 767-300. First class is so comfortable w/ the reclining seats and side table. So much leg room. Seats recline to laying flat to sleep. Seating area is clean. Side, front table folds down, and an add table from the side table comes out for meals. Lots of cargo space up top.I got a drink before take off. My flight attendant ""Indacia"" is super nice and asked if I would like to be woken up when food was served. YES! I was very pleased that she did that for me. Breakfast was scrambled eggs w/ English muffin Florentine w/ fresh fruit, yogurt, and a chocolate croissant. It was nice that she was addressing me by my name from the start before we took off. Mines not the easiest last name, but she kept trying. Restrooms were available in First Class (3). They were clean w/ all the amenities. An outlet to charge my phone and laptop also available at my seat. They do allow pets to fly. At the end of my row was the cutest lapdog w/ his owner. I would've never known he was there if he didn't pop his head up to look at me. He was well behaved."
"UPDATE: American Airlines get it together!!!! Another horrible experience. I guess the crew for my flight decided to huddle up and make an early exit since everyone but one boarded the plane (that one being me!) 5mins after boarding. Really mind-blowing how they managed to start boarding at 935a and have their doors closed by 940a (peculiar huh? Maybe they started boarding super early? My thoughts exactly!!)Long story short I showed up at 940a to a flight that started boarding at 935a and had to run around all day on standby. AND, here's the kicker, COULDN'T GET ON A DIFFERENT AIRLINE BECAUSE SOMEHOW IT WAS NOT THE AIRLINES FAULT!!!Please someone come and arrest these people."
Don't do it to yourself. Been a member for 3 years and will be bringing my services over to Delta from this point forward. Not even worth being a member. Don't waste your time.Bad bad service. Smh just bad. Don't waste your time or money.
"I do not recommend using this airline whatsoever. It is absolutely horrendous. They have no care for their customers and will cause u to become mentally unwell. They are greedy bitches who expect u to give them money and not do shit. They have a good rep but the truth is out now . Anyone that supports this company can meet me in the alleyway. #teamdelta #deltacomesfirst American airlines have no clue what they are doing and they are lucky they have people willing to work for such and awful company. They Have nobody who even knows how to work a plane for shit and could give less fucks if they had you sitting on a broken plane for hours. I haven't seen the workers on the plane in a while, They prob went out in lunch break, it would be no surprise. The planes haven't been cleaned in decades and they don't seem to plan on it ever. I shall never step foot in a place represented by such assholes.- Anonymous uncontent consumer"
"The worst experience from any airline I have traveled with.First they changed our sitting and my husband and I were separated.We were on hold for 2 and a half hours to try to correct it and they never came on line, we were forced to hang up and leave it unresolved and traveled separate.At the Santa Ana airport one long line to drop our bag and the representative took his sweet time.When we went in our connection to final destination from Phoenix to Philly, they did not offer a cookie or nuts, on a 4.5 hours flight and I had to call for them to please pick up the trash and the crew never showed up except for that one time. I guess they do not want to work during the flight.Finally when we went to p/u our luggage we were waiting under the belt for our flight only to discover they sent the luggage on a different belt that did not show our flight number."
Used AA for two first class flights to and from Key West Florida out of Philadelphia International airport. Flight to Key West was fantastic. Our flight attendant handed out complimentary Clorox wipes for our seating area. This same attendant did a fantastic job coming around and making sure we were comfortable and had plenty of drinks and snacks. If this was the only flight then I would have rated AA 5 stars. The flight from Key West to Philadelphia a completely different experience. This experience deserves zero stars. We boarded the plane and did not receive any wipes. The attendant came around one time to offer food and snacks and then hid behind the curtain not to be seen again. DO NOT WASTE your money on 1st class seating. It's apparent that AA does not do quality control when it comes to their employees. This is the second 1st class flight in two months that they came up short. It's time stop hiding behind COVID.
"I booked a disabled families member of a military family flight to help. The flier can only handle bags up to 15lbs so we used check in size, small. It took 2. The airlines charged us full price, $70 extra to fly. I went round and round and they did not care about any circumstances. I will make sure I myself,  and anyone else I can persuade, to never, ever, fly American Airlines! Never, ever, whichever one is longer!!"
"i had a fight Austin to Philly yesterday late morning. I am handicapped (restricted mobility, ataxic on my left, slurred speech from a stroke 2 years ago). im 45. ive never really been reached out for help. tried to remain as independent as possible. although i  arrived in plenty of time for my flight yesterday, the plane left without me. i was never called for, no one looked for me even though i was checked in and so was my luggage. the plane also left 10 minutes early!!!AA rebooked me on a flight connecting (and delayed)  through Chicago. i  should have been home in NJ at 9pm but instead it was 330am!what a horrible way to treat the disabled of America!!! NEVER  FLYING AMERICAN AGAIN"
American Airlines paidfordirect flight planewas late and then. Redirect it sowe neededto g back for fuel then theflight crew wentover hours andneededa new crew 2 hours then cancelled waiting hours inline to get another flight and they want me to take a two Flights 11 hours toget home the reason I booked this flight was I wanted a direct flight the are the worst uncaring    Airlines
It is absolutely stunning how they cancel a person's flight and not notify them in any way. Then rebook a five person group with 4 people going directly to Phoenix and then booking a 2 year old to fly solo to Orlando. So then the person who realized that my son was on a different plane decided to send us to Philadelphia and then to Phoenix 8 hours later. No compensation mentioned at all. No food vouchers for the airport while we sit in an airport with a  2 and 4 year old for 16 hours despite it was your company that completely dropped the ball. Not to mention I was charged $200 in order to book my flight in the 1st place that was canceled anyway. Waiting stand-by on the 2 flights leaving Chicago that were direct flights was never mentioned as a possibility. Looking forward to my flight being canceled then stranded in Philadelphia tonight!
"These people lie and they tell different lies to different people. A lady friend of mine and I booked flights at the American Airlines website, at the same time, on the same day, in November, 2021 to fly in February 2022. We had family issues and had to cancel the February 2022 flight and family vacation. She called American Airlines afterwards and they said we had until the November anniverary date in 2022 to use the credit towards booking another flight. She even asked, "" must we fly before the anniversary date or just book a future flight before the anniversary date""? They told her she just needed to book a flight by the anniversary date. I called American Airlines about a month before the 2022 anniversary date and they told me, too, that I needed to ""book"" a flight before the anniversary date and use the credit to pay for all or a portion of my future flight. Yesterday we both tried to book a flight and apply the credit (which was just shy of $500.00) and the AA website wouldn't apply the credit. So today we both called and they told me I was too late because I had to ""book and fly"" before the anniversary date and my credit had expired and that they were sorry but there was nothing they could do. My friend also called today and they happily and immediately applied her credit, towards a flight she was booking for June 2023. Tell me, how can a business the size of American Airlines give two completely opposite responses to two people with the ""exact"" same issue? Do they think they are the only airline I can use? If they do, they are sadly mistaken. I can fly to Orlando, FL via lots of different airlines and I certainly will. Shame on you American Airlines. You are a disgrace to your industry."
Terrible service! First the flight from LV was delayed about 45 minutes due to us waiting on the runway. Then when we arrived at PHL 15 minutes before departure of our connecting flight to. but the airline attendants closed the gate early. There was about 5 other people who missed the flight too. When we went to customer service desk the gentleman booked another flight that was departing in 10 minutes so we ran to the gate and arrived there on time before the plane was scheduled to depart but the attendants closed the gate early again and said there is nothing they can do. They didn't offer no compensation whatsoever until it took us begging for another flight that they booked us a flight for the next day. Not even a hotel room for the night. This is very disappointing for American Airlines to do this to people they don't care about. 0/10 I do not recommend booking American Airlines they do not help those in need of assistance. They don't even deserve the one star.
"Of course all they care about is money and not people. Our bags fit in the carry on bin but because they didn't make everyone in front of us verify that fact, we had to check our bags with sensitive souvenirs from Europe"
"What can I say, it's American Airlines.  They offer the most flights of any airlines.  They have a variety of old and new planes, from RJs to single and wide body planes from Boeing, Embraer and Airbus! Overall the staff is professional and friendly.  My first choice for flying in the United States.  You can't go wrong with AA!"
American Airlines is the most inept and inconsiderate airline I have ever flown on. We had a vacation planned for many months. Within 3 hours of departure they delayed the first flight so much that we couldn't make our connection.  Then they rescheduled the flights for the next day. The reason they delayed was they didn't have a crew to fly the plane.  A simple solution is to not schedule a flight if you don't have a crew. This took a day off of our vacation and put our rental car in jeopardy.  We had 5 adults and an 18-month old toddler flying with us.  Under the best circumstances this is challenging. Now it is a disaster.  This airline needs to go out of business or be taken over by someone who values its customers. Will never fly American again.
"Incompetent and horrible people working at the departures. I had all my Covid-19 documents and arrived in advance yet they still wasted all this time coming up with things I need and said I have plenty of time. Then when I had all 3 codes from the additional apps they told me to download they said 'it's too late to board' and claimed that they got me on the next flight instead the next day. I came back a day later for the flight and they said they couldn't get me in that flight I have to call the carrier airline and marked me as a no show, and just sent me in circles. They have no sense of human decency, were incredibly rude and lazy. I will never fly AA again not will my company."
"My husband died in October October 7, 2021 I had a trip that was booked I failed to call and cancel my flight because my mind was somewhere else they won't refund my my ticket it's like 160 some odd dollars in the educational enterprises has not refunded my money my husband died I don't know how many people think about their trips and canceling their tickets but I didn't so now I'm now over $1000 which I could use because my husband is dead how callous and thoughtless are these companies that all they care about is their money"
"Had a horrible experience at the kiosk check-in just for asking a kiosk worker if a particular unit was working (the screen was dark but the blue scanner underneath was lit, so I thought perhaps the screen was in sleep mode).  BONNIE the kiosk worker proceeded to gesture sarcastically and wildly while yelling rude and demeaning comments.  When I explained why I asked and that she could have just said yes or no, she became even more agitated and aggressive.  I hope someone at the airlines reads this and gives her some training and a reprimand."
Worst customer service ever!Flight canceled 1am no answers nor help from crew in Phl  Nathan ? Think it is Trout for last name was afraid for HIS safety! American needs to sell let Delta take overI will NEVER fly with you again!
"Trash, had us board plane knowing there was mechanical issues to then have everyone get back off. Will never fly American again!! Delta wouldn't let this happen."
"I had been traveling for over 12 hrs. from Greece, I had a flight on 9/23/21 from Philadelphia that was scheduled to leave at 10 am we got pushed back due to weather. This was supposed to be a 1hr flight, our gate was changed over 5 times.  Each time we changed gate I inquired about my luggage  because I had valuables/ irreplaceable gifts that I purchased for my family from Greece.Each time I asked  I was reassured that my bags were going to reach my final destination  and I had nothing to worry about. I finally got on a flight that was scheduled to leave at 4 pm by this time I had been traveling over 24 hrs. I was so exhausted my feet were swollen and all I wanted to do was get home shower and relax. I arrived at Norfolk as I approached baggage claims I received an e-mail that my bags were delayed. My fear became a reality, I immediately felt sick to my stomach I thought my day could not get worse and it did. I went ahead and scheduled for my luggage to be delivered. I was told it was going to be delivered at 6 am  I didn't get it until almost 11 am. I  immediately noticed my large suitcase was unlocked and reached to open it and once again my fear became a reality!I had several items missing 2 louis Vuitton bags,  2 Vanilla Diorama perfume, 1 Hermes perfume, 8 necklace sets, 1 Rouge Trafalgar perfume I started screaming and was shacking I have never felt so violated and invaded this is not acceptable. I summited a claim along with my receipts after my initial shock and awaiting their response. This was a horrible experience and not a good way to end my lovely trip."
"If American Airlines is typical of the industry as a whole, then air travel is doomed. I dropped my wife at the airport at 10:30 am for a 12:30 flight to Dallas. The flight was delayed multiple times, finally taking off at 2:37 pm. So of course, she missed her connecting flight in Dallas to Austin. She has mobility issues and was met at the gate with wheelchair service. But was taken to the connecting gate at 4 pm and left with no wheelchair.  She tried everything to get assistance but to no avail. She even called AA corporate, spent 60 min. on the phone only to be told they could not reach any AA employees to help her. When I found out at 7:45 pm I called AA corporate and got the runaround. So, I called DFW airport, and some young woman got an earful (sorry) but did solve the problem. You see my wife had been unable to reach a restroom or food since leaving home at 8:30 am. (12 hours) Then the gate was change from C20 to C8 then 15 min before boarding it was change to A6 3 floors down and the elevator was broken. Only through the kindness of another passenger did she even make the flight, which finally landed in Austin around 11:06 pm all told she spent 15 hours traveling 500 miles that could have been done by car in 8 hours. As another user wrote they should change their name to ""Abandoned Airlines""."
"This is quite possibly the most unprofessional business I think I've ever encountered. I have been at the Philadelphia International Airport since 3am (12 hours), had 2 flights cancelled (not the airline's fault), was bumped from a 3rd flight (was the airline's fault), I am now awaiting my 4th scheduled flight and there are NO pilots available to fly the plane (flight is delayed at least 2 hours) & I will most likely miss my connecting flight. Also, they just announced a flight to LA also has no pilots available!! Not to mention the fact that I paid to pick seats on all cancelled flights and no refund or credit was offered - I'll fight for that later!!"
"Needed people to check roller bags prior to boarding. When I boarded, the attendant claimed my bag was too big despite fact that it fit in sample bin AND I had arrived to Philly in the exact same type of airplane and stowed baggage above without issue. American has lost my luggage on three different occasions. Their track record is abominable in my experience. I'm holding my breath that I actually get my luggage at the other end."
"My morning was off to an extreme late start due to some technical difficulties as well as traffic. I arrived to the airport around 8:50am for a 9:30am flight with three other individuals. Due to having to check in a bag I was a bit further delayed but my friends were able to make the flight. Being as though I have never missed a flight in my life I was embarrassed, anxious, and upset. I spoke to one young lady at customer service who seemed to not care whether I made the flight or not and continued to be of no service to me after explaining my circumstance. I bumped into another young lady by the name of CHANDRA who took the time to attempt to accomodate me to the best of her abilities. Chandra was able to help me find a connecting flight out of Philly into Dallas which ultimately solved my issue. Chandra did not upcharge me or press me about having an economy ticket. Chandra does not know this trip is for my birthday and this far her willingness to assist and accomodate me has been the best birthday gift I have received. Thank you so much Chandra at customer service lower level C terminal. I am so appreciative that I had to take the time out to review even as I wait for this standby flight."
"Face-masks; I flew from 9am to 4pm on this airline wearing a face-mask with a oneway valved exhaust vent with no issues.  Flying back today an attendant at the gate tells me that the same mask is not allowed by this airline.  She goes on handing me a mask with no metal forming band over the nose, meaning the exhaust air passes freely both ways through the large openings around my nose.  I asked when the policy was enacted and after calling someone she answered, ""19 August 2020"".  My photos are of my original vented mask and what they provided to me to pose as a superior replacement for my ACC approved mask.  Vented FaceMaskThe US military's field protective mask, the M50 or M40, is completely inadequate to prevent the spread of a virus pandemic.  Anyone who has served in the US Military has seen the way the M50 or M40 mask works.  Bad air is filtered by a canister and oneway valves exhaust air directly out of the mask.  Logically, if you are sick this allows the release of some airborne droplets in the exhaust air.  But if you are not sick it is nothing but clean filtered air exhaled from an uninflected person.  Since everyone in a compromised environment would be wearing a mask then the risk of infection would be much reduced.  Enter the flimsy cloth mask.  A cloth mask does not even have the form fitted nose bridge.  This design failure allows the free exchange of air both while inhaling and exhaling, thus offering no protection for the wearer or those who would be exposed to the unfiltered second hand exhaust air, even if the wearer was uninflected.  A vented mask would still provide more protection than an ill conceived, none form fitting, cloth mask.  A none form fitting cloth mask like the one I was provided by American Airlines as a replacement for my form fitting, active carbon filtered, three cloth layers of filter media (outside layer disposable/replaceable and inside layer washable).  So it would seem that if I was wearing my military field protective mask that I would be asked to remove it and in its place use a completely inadequate DIY unapproved and impossible to seal leaking mask.  A DIY, cloth mask that apparently the CDC approves of wearing in place of even a military mask proven to stop nuclear, biological, and chemical contamination for the wearer.  I guess we are going to ignore the fact that DIY cloth masks, like the one I was provided by American Airlines, leak air in both directions, ultimately protecting no one."
"Up until today, I thought American Airlines was the best airlines. Clean, efficient, and trustworthy. I even purchased shares as I believed they would be the leader of airlines throughout this pandemic and going forward. However, after the many flaws I witnessed on my last trip, ultimately ending in a very disrespectful and appalling handling of customers by Philadelphia Airport Customer Service staff members Johnny and ATR, I will not only dissuade from traveling AA from here forward. Their treatment, in addition to the lack of social distancing considerations, American Airlines has very little grip on their services, handlers and provider of services as well. Convinced that this company is going from bad to worse, I shall also sell off my current shares of the company as I have no faith this company will stay a float with such practices. More importantly, I will express in detail this nasty experience to everyone and how it was all in direct correspondence to the management, company policies and lack of customer empathy."
"Terrible service and lack of customer care. We were slated to return to California, but of course our flight was canceled. In an attempt to rebook myself and my two children, were met with the gruff customer service of Lisa. She not only was unkind but clearly does not like people or her job - she was clearly frustrated that I was a challenge to rebook a family of three back to California from Philadelphia. Many times she repeated that she had worked on our route for 15 minutes - THAT'S YOUR JOB!!!!  She refused to put us in a hotel for the night and the only flight she could find has a 7 hour layover in Dallas. Are you kidding me?  The flight is clearly not comparable in cost to what I booked, but American didn't care. I spoke to a CSM as at least got a hotel room for the night but no hope for getting home until the next day and not guaranteed seats together for myself and my 5 and 8 year old. I understand everyone is stressed and overwhelmed, as an educator who opened schools during a pandemic, but a little customer service goes a long way. Highly disappointed in American, highly disappointed in Lisa and her lack of kindness and service. Fingers crossed we get home today!"
"The worst flying experience I have ever had, absolutely Horrible. I will pay extra not to fly American at this point. My flight to Portland got canceled as I landed in Philly for my layover. It was due to labor shortages after COVID, but American blamed it on weather so they didn't have to pay for our hotels. After waiting in a line to reschedule my flight for over an hour, I went to get my checked bag from customer service. It was like a zoo...bags were lined up everywhere and I was told to submit a ticket to pick my bag up, wait 1-3 hours, then call AA after three hours. When I asked the representative which number I should call, he tells me ""you can look up the number on google"". So the general AA phone number, which had a wait time of over four hours. I ended up getting my bag, five hours later, it was on a baggage carousel in a completely different terminal. American is so cheap, and they need new management! Will never fly American Airlines again, nor will I ever fly into Philadelphia ever again!!!"
"No Star at all if I can. I traveled with 2 minors (6 and 9 years old). They seated my kids far away from me. I called 1 week in advance to ask them put us sit together. They refused to do so and asked us to pay. The manager even said ""We don't accommodate minors."" That is terrible statement and service. Never flight from them again."
"Wish I could give no stars. Worst airline I've ever traveled with, do yourself a favor and don't go with them!! After two delays for our first flight for maintenance issues on their end we made it to our layover with 25 minutes to spare. We showed up to the gate looking at the plane still on the ground and we're told it was too late and they wouldn't let us on. Next flight out wasn't until the next day. Would not recommend to anyone, horrible customer service and rude"
"Today we are flying out of Philadelphia with Lisa, who is such a great flight attendant and employee. She is making this flight one of the best I've ever enjoyed. Service with Lisa and the flight crew has been amazing! We love American Airlines because of the people who work there. The flight is perfect, even with strong winds. Imagine landing on a windy day that didn't effect our flight! I recommend American Airlines to anyone who still doesn't have a private jet! Thank you again American Airlines for the perfect hire of Lisa."
This one the worst U.S. airlines i was supposed to be in st Louis today coming from Richmond VA. I get to the airport at 4:30am for a 6:30am flight. First the plane would not start then once they started the plane we all boarded sat at the gate for 10min then pushed away for the pilot to drive around the airport (I am not kidding). He finally pulled over to the side  runway and said the FAA would not let him take off so we sat for an 45 min after the long wait the pilot comes back on the mic and says the FAA  cleared him to fly but the tower will not let him go all the time the idiot flight attendant is telling people to stay seated then she says we can go to the bathroom then back to stay seated after another half hour the pilot gets his story together and says we can leave. Sitting on a plane for almost two hours for 65 min flight. Once in Philadelphia i am told my flight to St Louis will leave at 3:30pm then an hour later i am told it's move to 5:30pm in other words AA can only get me as far as Philadelphia. They had me get up to be on a plane at 6:30 am so i could fly an hour away and sit in an airport for 8hrs this company sucks
"The ONLY good thing about this airline are the inexpensive tickets and that they manage to get you to your destination in one piece. I have flown with them multiple times and have been disappointed with the service and the overall experience, each time. The flight attendants do not assist the passengers with fitting their luggage into the overhead spaces. I have seen passengers helping one another while the flight attendant just stands there and watches. The complimentary service and planes are just above satisfactory.I had an experience where I called into their customer service line to add a flight for my sister, I felt like the whole process took longer than necessary. Went through the process of giving my credit card information and the representative said that I was all set like the flight had been added, the next day I was looking for the confirmation for the flight purchase with the record locator and I never received one. Come to find out the flight was never made and the representative had taken down my card info! Two days later, I got a fraud detection email from my bank stating that someone was trying to make a purchase that didn't look like it was legitimate...need I say more?! If you can find another airline to fly with, I would go with the other option. Only make this airline your last resort choice. Customer service with American is bottom of the barrel."
"This is my first time flying American Airlines in probably over 10 years, and the only reason I flew at this time was because they had a direct flight from Philadelphia to Key West, if I could have found another airline with a direct flight I would've taking that. It was very nice that they did give me the option a few days before my flight to upgrade to first class which was a pleasure going to Key West, we get to the Key West airport and they only had one baggage carousel working when in the airport they have to so everyone on the flight stood there for over 45 minutes waiting for their luggage to come off. The flight home out of Key West international airport was a disaster the flight did not leave until 3 PM and it was supposed to leave at 2:48 PM and then we get into Philly and they never tell us what baggage carousel to go to to pick up our luggage. I don't think I will be flying AmericanAirlines anytime in the near future. The customer service is not great at all and on a three hour flight home I saw the flight attendant one time throughout the whole trip that's when she brought us a bag of pretzels and a soda never came up to check make sure everything was OK."
"The only thing I learned trying to fly American Airlines is, DON'T DO IT! They  can't complete the only task they have agreed to, which is get you from point A to point B. Sitting stranded in Philly for 10 hours is no place to be during a Pandemic. American Airlines does not care for the health, safety, or wellfare of their customers. It's pretty clear to see based on my fellow passengers stranded alongside me here tonight. Choose an airline that wants to survive the Pandemic. With less then half as many costumers and literally only agreeing to perform the only task they are required to, they have still failed. You'll be given a $12 dollar meal voucher for their failures and sent off with a, sorry that's the best that we can do. Don't chance it folks fly another airline, there's so many to choose from."
"Won't ever fly American again. The rudeness of their employees is unparalleled. As I was about to board the plane with my carry on bag that I fly with about 10 times a month, I was told it won't fit into their sized spaces. Understandable. However, when my bag was placed into their box that sizes suitcases and didn't fit because the front pocket stuck out I was held up and bullies into checking it. If their employee would have gotten off their high horse and allowed me to place the bag in the box it would have fit because all you had to do was tuck the pocked. She just wanted to charge me money for a checked bag though and didn't even allow me to touch my OWN luggage. I would have just grabbed my stuff and walked right out if I wasn't required to be somewhere at a certain time. Needless to say my trip could have gone smoothly if their employees took a little bit of time to be courteous to the travelers and not be so bent on just charging me money to check a bag that was placed into the box a way it wouldn't fit."
They are not respecting any distance between people. It's already bad breathing in recycled air but now space just to make a profit is not smart either. This is crazy.
Won't be using them again. Have use packed in for another full flight. No regard for social distancing. Also just came from Boston. During the flight the flight attendant continually removed her face mask so she could talk about how amazing her dinner experience was. They need to follow Delta and not pack the flights so full. This is ridiculous! I will fly Delta from here on.
"The Woman at the gate scanning tickets was beyond rude. I understand they need people to check in carry on bags to make more room. She announced it 700 times and said group 9, people near the end she would be taking bags as the line narrowed down. I made sure to be first in group 9 cause I had a lot of meds packed way in the bottom of my Carry on and money. She looked at my bag and said it was too big. Um I have traveled with this bag for 15 years, i showed her it fit in the little box they had . She said oh well we need people to give bags and your one?? I said no, my bag and coming with me and she said no it's not! She wraps a tag around it and hands me a tag. I snatched it and walked away. She yelled ""don't you ever snatch something from me"", then she THROWS my bag and KICKS it! Everyone in line went ""OMG"" to what she did! Classy worker American Airline, Falsely saying my bag too big which so funny cause I have traveled with you plenty before NO problem and guess what, my bag fit! Watch your tv monitor from B10 6/29 at 6:20pm flight. You will see it yourself ."
I will Never fly on your airline again. Bought a first class ticket over a month ago get to airport they call me and tell me they are moving me to seat 9d they had to reconfigure the flight and I get screwed while the non paying chairmen preferred gets the first class and I top of it they give me some 8 so now my luggage has to be checked you and your airline deserves to go bankrupt customer service is not what you do bump the free loader like USAir used to bump me if while I was gold had a first class upgrade and then the equipment change happens but no no more they bump paying customers. I have cut up my American Air master card and my American air point card me and my whole family will never get on one of your flights ever again I would rather fly southwest over you now all my future trips will be on Any other airline than America. Your people don't care the screwed me a all they offered was to refund the difference nothing at all for screwing me.  I buy first class isle seats because I cannot fly if I am in other seats I am very claustrophobic  but you do not care.  Great job pissing off a customer who flew American all the time good luck keep on screwing your passengers and have fun in bankruptcy.
