"Great flight experience to and from Detroit.Both flights, we arrived earlier than expected.  We left out during the rain from Ian.  The pilot announced that we would encounter some turbulence until we reached our 38,000 foot height and break through the clouds.  It was so smooth from that point on.  He made us aware of what was going on the whole time.On my flight home, we didn't hear much from the pilot at all.  They had beverage service on this flight and gave out cookies or pretzels.  There was one flight attendant who looked as though she was ready to fight.  Her face was balled up the whole time.  Fortunately, I didn't encounter her, just noticed her face throughout the flight.Great flights.  I hate flying and very rarely will do it!  But they are slowly restoring my confidence"
"Our first and last trip with American Airlines. We booked for our honeymoon an earlier flight down to Cabo to which we paid extra for. Flight was delayed due to maintenance so we got down there at the same time we would have wit mo compensation. On our flights back, we got delayed three times and one delay causing us to miss our connecting flight. We talked to customer service and the next flight out was the following day at 10:15am. We had to ASK for a place to stay as it was over ten hours away to which we were given an attitude as a response. The hotel they put us in reeked of pot and was filthy."
"By far the worst airline I have flown. The rudest desk/gate agents. Horrible flight attendants. I was made to check my carry on which was smaller than the allotted size. Why? Because the gate attendants allowed passengers with multiple full size luggage to board as opposed to making them check the luggage that was clearly way larger than carry on guidelines. Any other airlines would not allow this to happen. And the gate attendants that made me check the bag were so rude!  In addition to that we purchased months in advance upgraded seats. The main cabin preferred with extra leg room. But lo and be hold we got bumped a month before the flight to basic economy. For no reason. I would have understood if our tickets had been purchased via 3rd party but they were purchased directly through American.  The seats were the most uncomfortable seats I've sat in on an airline with the least mount of leg room. We were packed in sardines tighter than that other big yellow airline which I would expect such service from.   In addition the flight attendants never offered assistance to anyone with putting it removing luggage from the overhead(maybe a good thing they made me check my bag). They just stated ""if you can't lift it neither can we"".   When they Came around to collect trash.. the attendants walked by quickly not giving everybody an opportunity to throw away their debris   We payed $1300 per ticket for an insanely long flight and we're miserable.  Never again will I fly American Airlines!"
Horrible airline!!! Horrible experience flying from the Dominican Republic in august to my son traveling hime from military deployment and they lose his luggage! American Airlines absolutely suck!!!!
"#AA#AARound of applause for Chrisopher Draus and one of his co-workers at the AA counter (I forgot to ask for her name, she did have on a cast).Great customer service and loyal employee. Both AA agents went above and beyond to resolve our delayed flights. He apologized profusely on AA behalf, in which I told him, its not his fault.Not all heroes wear capes but Christopher was our hero. LOOKING FORWARD to traveling with AA again.Thanks again Christopher Draus, we all made it home safely."
A very unapologetic airline.  With the price of airline tickets one would think this airline would be one of the better ones.  But I'm beginning to make this my last airline of choice. Flight delays from the starts.  Almost two hours.   Last year I had a flight canceled all together.  I didn't get flight until the next morning.
"VacationI will never fly #AmericanAirlines again!When leaving Cancun, we had to go to the counter because we had an infant. The agent at the desk, somehow, accidentally cancelled three of our tickets. After 1.5 hours of standing, with three children, they finally got us back on our flight home. This gave us just enough time to eat and get to the gate before they closed the doors.We had a layover in Dallas. We realized that they didn't print us our connecting flight boarding pass... so we now have to go to that counter. We sent our bags on their way and went to get out next boarding passes... only to be faced with the same problem. The people in Mexico only fixed the problem for their flight, not our connecting. We now stood their for 1.5 hours before the lady apologized and a said that we were not going to make that flight. She also said that there was not another flight to Detroit until tomorrow and it would also be once with a layover. After two hours of standing... we agreed to a flight home tomorrow at 1020 and Brian had to call off of work. She went to talk to management and they gave us a room at a hotel that was a 15 minute shuttle ride away and $12.00 food vouchers. At this time, it's after 930 at night and the kids are starving. We walk around the airport for about 45 minutes looking for somewhere to eat but everything closed at 9. We decided that we would just get to the hotel and order them pizza.  It was after 11 and we were so tired. Once we arrived to the hotel we learned that the free shuttle was full for the next morning. They gave us the number for a cab service. It was $40 to get back to the airport. We ordered food from the hotel and they accepted the food vouchers. The food was 16-18 each meal.. and didn't include drinks. So much for $12  we didn't have any of our luggage... so no toothbrushes or anything. We had our ride to the airport pick us up at 8 and headed straight to our gate. Our flight was headed to Philadelphia and then to Detroit. They had our seats all split up. The best they said they could do was move me next to Leilani. Ok fine... Isabella and Brian had to sit away from each other. We sat on the runway for almost an hour before they announced overhead that they had an issue declaring some dry ice or something and now that we've sat this long, we had to go back to the gate to refuel. Everett was asleep through all of this. After 1.5 hours of sitting, we finally took off. Everett woke up 30 minutes into the actual flight... and was horrible. He was over it all. It was the longest 3 hours of my life. The flight attends on this flight we're absolutely amazing because I was a sobbing hot mess. We arrive to Philadelphia exactly one minute before our connecting flight took off. We had to go to costumer service and explain that our last flight had a delay and made us miss our connecting flight. After a little bit we had a new flight... but had to wait 3 hours.  We finally boarded a flight to Detroit!!I don't know if they were just messing with me... but they had an issue on that plane as well!! We sat on the plane for over after the time it was supposed to take off. I understand that things happen... but none of this was our fault... and I felt like we were not cared about!"
I enjoy flying American Airlines mostly because the flight attendants have excellent customer service. This last time I flew was allot different experience. The flights are still full which shocked me because I was told spacing between seats was in effect. The in flight beverages and snacks has been eliminated as well. I understand the beverage and snack policy though. Masks are required the entire flight as well. The world has changed because of Covid 19 and I'm just happy I can still travel by plane. The service was wonderful and the plane boarding and Unboarding went smoothly. The plane was clean as well. American Airlines has the flying business down to an efficient science. Looking forward to next months trip to Miami on American Airlines. They keep my business because they do what's right for the customer every time. Give them a try and you'll be happy you did.
"I will never be flying American Airlines again! Went to Cancun on vacation with my family, my wife and 3 kids (9,5,1) and on our way home as were paying for our luggage the lady that took our payment somehow cancelled our reservation for our flight right there on the spot. We stood there for 60-90 minutes while at least 5 of them gathered up trying to fix the problem. Once they finally fixed the problem we get make that flight to Dallas, TX only to find out that they didn't fix our connecting flight to Detroit but also cancelled our reservation for that flight. The lady there said that whoever touched this before her really messed things up and she was unable to get us on our flight home. They gave us a voucher for a hotel that was 15 minutes away and had to take a shuttle to it instead of putting us up in the hotel that's right there in the airport. They gave us food vouchers worth $12 a piece but everywhere in the airport was closed. We were able to use them at the hotel, but everything was at least $15 and still had to pay out of pocket. The shuttles in the morning to get to the airport were completely full until after our flight would have already left, so I had to order a taxi, another out of pocket expense and inconvenience to have to set it all up. We finally make our flight from Dallas to Philly and they split us all up. My wife had a crying baby with no help from me because I was stuck a few rows back in a crammed row. One of my daughters had to sit by herself in between 2 strangers which made her and myself very uncomfortable. We end up sitting on the tarmac for at least 45 minutes only to be told that we have to return to the gate. Something about the weight of dry ice and then since we sat out there so long we had to refuel. Now with all that, we again missed our connecting flight home. So we had to sit in the terminal another 3 hours to wait for our flight.  Finally after all that we make it on our flight home and of course to top it off we had the rudest flight attendant I've ever had! I understand that things happen, but the stress and frustration that all this out on my family is unlike anything we've ever experienced. My kids asking why we can't just take a flight home and all I can say is that one lady messed up everything so now we have to deal with all these let downs because of one persons actions. I've flown Spirit and Delta for years and NEVER had anything remotely close to this happening. I will continue to give them my business and never spend another dime on anything to do with American Airlines!"
"I was going on a trip to St Lucia. I personally was not in a rush but my friend wanted to go. We got a covid test because this the requirement for entry. 5 day results prior to entry. Its the first time i traveled during covud but did not know how crazy it was. We contacted Uber for a pickup but I guess everyone is sleep at 5am. We drove ourselves to the airport and parked in the Blue lot. Pretty simple. We then proceeded inside. This is where there was total Kaos. The agent that assisted with the checkin was really helpful. We had to pull up our test results and destination. We even got bumped ahead because out flight time was approaching. We were directed to the line and were told to go to a shorter line on the other side for the security check. Nope...You need to go back. That is closer. Then to make matters worse they did not put TSA PRE on our tickets. Once we got up to the check they put my bag back through twice. First time was a bad scan, second time was for a gel based mouse pad. WOW. After all of this I missed my flight by half a minute. I will be doing it all over again tomorrow. Instead of showing up an hour and a half early I will do 2 this time. Hope to get through the Kaos. Crazy times."
"This review is for the CEO of American Airlines.  You keep sending me emails telling me how safe your keeping me during the Covid-19 pandemic. As long as you are selling the middle seat (which you know you are) you are not keeping anybody safe.  You are placing profits above people  ...... So, Go take a flying leap at 35000'.  And one more thing... your rewards miles are absolutely worthless they force people to take extremely long layovers with extremely stupid departure and arrival times,  designed for the most inconvenience possible.  Delta Airlines rewards program beats yours on their worst day.  You simply don't care."
My daughter flew with American Airlines today. She was on crutches doing to an injury. They went above and beyond to make sure that she got to the terminal safely and then boarded safely. They were very caring and understanding. Thank you
Rude flight attendant and check in attendant! trying to travel for my birthday and got the worst service i've ever got. also delayed my flight twice.
"I will do my best to never again fly American Airlines as long as I live. Although I got to Detroit safely, my bag did not.  There was a 90 minute window at my connection, plenty of time for the bag to have gotten to the appropriate connecting flight, but instead apparently the bag was put on a later flight. The baggage claims office at the Detroit airport assured me that the bag was due to arrive at 7:11 last night - about 4 hours after the initial expected arrival - and would be delivered that evening to my hotel. It is now nearly 2 in the morning I still have not gotten my bag and after a 20 minute conversation with customer service I finally had to badger the customer service person into apologizing for the delay which is now, apparently, delayed until 730 tomorrow night. 24 hours after the bag has arrived, late.  The mistake was completely their's, and sometimes all the customer wants is an apology, a sincere apology, from the airlines for their mistake. But the customer service representative I spoke to was clearly more interested in reading from a script and engaging in the time honored tradition of ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" which is not an apology at all. I still have no confidence whatsoever that I will ever see my bag again, much less tomorrow. I understand mistakes happen, I understand screw ups happen, but for god sake take responsibility. I will truly do my best never to fly this airlines again as long as I live."
"First time taking American Airlines (AA) since 2001. I always fly Delta but I decided to take AA because I was flying to Charlotte (their hub), the tickets prices were the same as Delta, and the flight got there a little earlier. I purchased 3 tickets, joined their rewards program, and waited to check-in 24 hours before the flight. Upon checking in I noticed there was only one free seat to choose from and all the rest of the seats cost additional money. The Airline warned me that seats might not be available next to me if I don't pay extra....which I get, however upon checking in they placed my wife and child together with me several rows back (the free seat). I could purchase the seat next to my wife and child (yes the row was not full) for additional money. I just don't get it...with the covid-19 epidemic going on....why, when you have the capability, would you not sit the family together? The kicker was the seat was given to a 20-year-old who bought the ticket and didn't pay extra for the seat herself. ???? They could have put her in the free seat and let me sit next to my family in the same row which would make us all feel safer from covid-19. On the way back from Charlotte to Detroit, AA placed my wife and child on aisle seats (same row) and put me in the back again. I questioned the passengers next to my wife and they stated that they didn't know each other and didn't pay extra for the seats. Once again my family could have sat together but the possibility for us to pay extra for seating was more important to AA than making my family feel safer on their airline.  AA please feel free to contact me if you have any questions and we can also discuss the language of the cleaning crew as we were deplaning the aircraft...All I can say is unbelievable.Jacques MalboeufAA Number R255LL8"
We paid $300 to be packed in a flight like sardines during a pandemic! This flight was not socially distance and American Airlines is not practicing social distancing! This airline should be shut down they are apart of the covid crisis in America. Shame on you American Airlines
The seats were comfortable!!! Let me say again the seats were comfortable!!!!! Download the app before flying and bring plug in headphones (not wireless) they have free movies!!! The staff was super friendly!!! Like this airline!!!!
"I will never take an American Airline flight again. I called three days in advance to ask if I could change the time of my flight, as my grandfather passed away and I need to attend his memorial service. Your agent Maria, kept me on the phone for over 30 minutes to ask me what my grandfather's name was, what the funeral home's name and address are, the phone number, and the time of the service. All of this to simply change the time on a return flight. The agent agreed to ""let me change the flight time"" but with a $189 charge, which I am not able to pay. Shame on your company policies and your agents for their insensitivity and inflexibility. You should be embarrassed to have your employee grill a customer on details of a funeral simply to change the time of a flight. You are by far the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune of traveling with. I would advise all others to stay away."
"Dear ignorant passengers,Yes, that would be you if you ignored the three AA workers that asked if you've printed your checked baggage tag at the kiosk and you're waiting in the bag drop line with no bag tag.Yes, that includes you new mom who flew with their infant screaming child, patting them on the back and shushing them. Please remember a bottle, pacifier, your breast, your finger to suck on during takeoff and landing to help their ears pop. No amount of shushing and bouncing is going to help relieve the painful pressure building up in their little head because you're unprepared. Yet you remembered your tablet, phone and book for yourself. Smh!Yes, that includes you smelly man sitting next to me, who would not stop talking.  If you are traveling alone, please shower before your flight. Showering is not necessary if you're sitting next to a SO who doesn't mind the occasional whiff of BO. When someone puts earbuds in and closes their eyes, it's not an invitation to rub their arm and ask questions such as ""are you enjoying the flight?"" We haven't taken off yet. ""I wonder what that water is called"". We are on a flight to Chicago. It's Lake Michigan. ""Oh what a pretty city, I wonder where we are.""  It's Chicago. ""Where are you from?  I'm from Chicago"". DOH!!!Other than a bunch of annoying passengers, the AA workers were pleasant at checkin and at the gate."
"I fly American Airlines all the time but this last time got me thinking to never again. I got tickets for 5 people. Our flight was at 6:20 am from DTW to Chicago to Nashville. Everything was running smooth and we boarded the plane. Sat there for a few minutes and the pilot said that Chicago has blocked all the incoming flights due to thunderstorms and it could take 45 min or longer until we would take off so we were asked to step out and wait at the airport instead.  We had no other choice and it was understandable to this point. Once we left the plane, we went to customer service as it was likely we would miss our connecting flights. The agents were not helpful at all. Couldn't provide information and kept saying i don't know. 45 min or so later, we were told Chicago removed the restriction and we would be able to take off. We on boarded the plane. Waited for about 30 minutes and the pilot stated that he is waiting for the employees to fill up the plane with gas. Not sure why they would do that at that time when they had all the time in the world but regardless we had no choice but to go with what  they said. A few minutes passed by and the pilot stated that Chicago put the restriction back as it was thunder storming again. This is what got a lot of us mad. If we didn't wait for over 30 min to get gas (if that was even a thing), we would have been to Chicago already before the new so called restriction. We were told to get off the plane once again. And didn't get to leave DTW until around 10:00 (our initial flight was at 6:20 am). At this point, we missed our connecting flight from Chicago to Nashville, which was at 7:50 am, and asked customer service multiple times to ensure the next available flight. Agents weren't helpful at all as if they didn't care. We went to Chicago and were told that we would put on a standby for all the flights departing from Chicago to Nashville that day. Mind you, we were 5 people. The staff there was rude. Especially since we would go to each gate each time a new flight would take off. One of the staff members told us off and it was very uncalled for. We didn't leave Chicago until 6:30 pm and arrived in Nashville at around 7:30 pm. We were going to Nashville on a weekend trip and planned it so that we could arrive there at 9:00 am so we could have three full days (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) but due to all this trouble, we lost a whole day which meant a whole day of exploring and all the reservations and tickets we had already paid for for that day. At no point did the staff offer us comfort or even some sort of reimbursement. It was the complete opposite. Rude, rude, rude!!!!! We were at the airport for over 16 hours for a flight that was only an hour and a half. This is outrageous. We could have drove at our destination in 7 hours. Instead of wasting it at airports. The staff clearly seemed to be lying about all the flights departing. It seemed as if American was the only ones not taking off. We would see the other airlines do so.  I've never had issues in the past with American but this time has made me skeptical about using them again."
We flew American Airlines from Grenada to Detroit with a stopover in Miami. We were delayed 50 minutes on the outbound. It took another 50 minutes to gather our luggage. By the time we rechecked our bags they had decided that we did not have enough time to get to our connecting flight and put us up in a hotel with a $12 meal voucher. The whole fault was with American Airlines. Very poorly run with rude personnel. The three agents at the rechecking area were making crude rude remarks about the passengers waiting in line it was unbelievable
"We had a great experience today.  Diana, a ticket agent for American was very friendly and helpful.  My husband is on crutches and she did all she could to make it easy on him.  Plane is leaving on time and all is good."
"Very friendly stewards and stewardesses. A simple 90minute flight from Philadelphia, half full plane. Waited for my 1 bag of luggage. Never came. Went to office , they said it's definitely in the airport. Was told to follow a gentleman- he checked all over - no bag. After a 20 minute wait, filled out form and bag was delivered to my house today."
"they canceled our flight for no reason and then took our money!! as well as that, the seats and spaces are way too small. As a 5'10 person my legs are cramped in the small spaces. Terrible experience everytime and do NOT suggest this airline. Even spirit is better even though they are 75% less. So I am warning anyone who is getting a flight from American Airlines,,, DO NOT DO IT!!!!! Terrible"
"I would give them negative 5 if I could. The customer service is appalling, at the check in counters in new york and even at the admiral's lounges there. They pretend to be helpful & really don't do much at all. In the end they ask you to sort out tour iwn flight matters. The planes are average. Sometimes I don't find any difference flying budget or AA in terms of comfort  (but I am petite so room isn't an issue).. On the flight apart from the free drinks it is essentially the same as any budget airline. I wish Qantas would partner with someone else.."
"This is the worst airline by far, id probably rather fly spirit. Ive had a non stop ticket to Miami from Detroit for the 26th of December for about 3 months now, and they just now on the 24th let me know that there is now three stops in between. This is one of the most ridiculous things thats ever happened to me while traveling, I am pissed beyond resolve. I will never ever fly American Airlines again, and I'm making sure no family member or friends do either. Please do not use this airline they are horrible. DELTA FROM NOW ON !!!!!"
Worst airlines ever! Complete rude assholes. I had to cancel my flight 2 weeks in advance & they wouldn't refund me. I got a COURT ORDER that I couldn't travel. I sent them a copy and they said fuck you to me.
"Flight got delayed and so our connecting flight got canceled and our layover turned from a 2 hour layover to a 12 hours layover, because their earliest flight wasn't until the next day. The airports security itself closed at 11:30 so by the time we had arrived and got our boarding passes we couldn't even get through to the rest of the airport. We were forced to sleep on the floor and the only thing to eat was a Starbucks. They told us they didn't care about accommodating us, and one of the workers gave us a coupon for local hotels, which none of them around took. What a slap in the face. I will never take American Airlines ever again and would warn everyone else not to as well."
"Dear American Airlines, I would like to publicly thank and compliment Ms. Teresa Todd in Detroit Metro Airport for her outstanding service. I was checking in for a flight to D.C. when I had left my folder with important documents at the counter. She had paged me multiple times throughout the terminal and eventually came all the way to the gate where I was scheduled to depart for my flight and handed the folder to me. Thank you Ms. Todd for your great act of kindness and service. The folder was crucial to my travel and work and I would've been in a big mess if it weren't for you, so thank you again. Best,Lee"
"Absolutely pathetic customer service from American Airlines.. First, they cancelled the flight to Orlando and informed me, and many other fliers, two hours before the scheduled departure. Second, they gave us another flight the next day, while they gave us the reason that due to weather they could not fly to Orlando. They lied, they had fights flying to Miami the same day, 30 mins later. Third, I asked for a refund, since they were unable to give me a confirmed seat the same day, but they could not do that either.Absolutely unhelpful behavior from the customer service agents at the airport, a flight full of people stranded at the airport and they had 2 people responding at the desks. Very very unprofessional."
This has been the worse flying experience I have ever had. No information about what is going on. Minimal last minute direction spoken rudely by staff. Never again. Don't do it people. It's not worth the price you pay. What in the world happened to AA?
I will never fly American Airlines again they have the worst customer service ..I purchased 3 tickets and needed to Change the date that I was flying due to some medical things that I needed to have taken care of before I could fly out ..I was told that it would be $300 extra per each ticket that I purchased  Which is totally ridiculous.. Absolutely the worst experience I have ever had flying in my life .If you're thinking about flying American Airlines think again.. They are not accommodating at all and could care less about how you feel as a customer I am all around just unhappy ..
"This is why American Airlines is terrible! at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. These are difficult times for American Airlines.The unpleasant dispute with its mechanics is beginning to wear on the airline's ability to maintain good service. Worse, the airline's financial performance has been wearing at Wall Street's worry beads.Adding to this turbulent atmosphere, passengers haven't exactly been ululating with glee at the airline's new, so-called Oasis configuration.That's the one that shoves more seats into planes, reduces legroom for all passengers, and, as a cherry on top, inserts tiny bathrooms. Some passengers are apparently avoiding these bathrooms entirely, preferring to hold their bodily functions in until they land. Oh, and the seatback screens are no more, though the overhead bins are bigger.Some might wonder whether all these woes are related.Last week, one financial big-brain finally plucked up the courage to air that thought to American's CEO, Doug Parker.At the JP Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Conference, Jamie Baker -- who works for JP Morgan -- wondered whether there was some relationship between the airline's poor financial performance and ""the Oasis experience.""As View From The Wing's Gary Leff reported, Baker added: ""Maybe it's the configuration of the aircraft that's holding you back, from a revenue perspective?""Could it be this idea hadn't quite entered the minds of American's management? It's surely well known that if you treat your customers poorly, they may not continue using your service.It's also true that American has become the poster infant for domestic customer mistreatment. Then again, for the longest time Parker didn't even bother trying the new Oasis product. He didn't even understand why anyone would care that he hadn't. When he finally tried it, he offered a lukewarm review.Perhaps that's why Parker, according to Leff, took this brutally direct question and offered a painfully evasive response. As Leff writes:""He did not talk about retrofitting the domestic fleet. He did not talk about the domestic (Oasis) product. Instead he acknowledged the revenue gap against Delta and United, suggested 'We were making enormous progress 2015, 2016, 2017' -- notably right before they began rolling out this new inferior product -- 'and then '18 we trailed those two...'Yes, but why did they suddenly begin trailing the other two?Parker performed a pivot. He began to talk about other issues, including American's uncompetitive sub-cattle class (a.k.a. basic economy) product.Finally, there was an explanation that may affect some customers' breathing.Parker said American was ""behind Delta on merchandising."" Ah, so the product is wonderful. It's just that American is marketing it poorly.Can't you see this, American customers? Why can't you see this?All airlines have their issues. But to blame the performance of something that's manifestly not a good idea -- how can reducing legroom in first class ever be a way to attract more business travelers? -- on how you're selling it borders on the risible.In previous pronouncements, Parker suggested the larger overhead bins and improved WiFi are the most important elements of the new configuration.Fly American. The symbiosis of WiFi and thrombosis!Parker has also declared that what passengers care about most is whether their flight arrives on time.Perhaps, though, it's worth Parker considering whether degrading the essential comfort of a plane might make customers feel uncomfortable about his brand.Customers have power and sometimes they wield it.They'd wield it even more if they had more choice as to which airlines they can fly."
"Ok, so I guess I'm partial on this one, but I LOVE AA, especially in DTW! 1) because I work for them, and 2) because I'm originally from Detroit. I no longer live here, but every time I travel through here, I'm greeted with smiling faces and a friendly hello. Never are there long lines, and I love the power charging station. It's a nice clean new airport, and never have any issues flying through here! AA is such a great airline, always trying to stay ahead of the game!"
"Well, American did it again.  Same son. Different trip. He was supposed to fly out to Las Vegas just after Christmas.  His flight was cancelled an hour before take-off because they hadn't ""recovered"" from the storms over 24 hours before. Bad enough that it was cancelled but if it was due to a storm from 24 hours before, didn't they know it would be cancelled before that?So he returned the next day for his rescheduled flight.  Flight delayed, then canceled. AA custv suggested he take a later flight into Chicago and HOPE that the connector is delayed.  What kind of advice is that?  He didn't do it, and good thing. He would have been stranded in Chicago.Next flight out:  2 days later.  American Airlines stole 3+ days from my son's trip, and they wouldn't even offer him food vouchers for the times he was stuck at the airport waiting for a ride back home. Never ever again."
