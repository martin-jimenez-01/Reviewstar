"Flew TPA to DCA, and back with AA. The flight was clean and quiet, both for the morning trip out, and afternoon flight home. Small delay due to weather, totally justifiable. The flight attendants were all courteous on both flights.Having to pay an additional charge to choose a seat to sit next to your spouse to make it appear that your pricing is competitive was irritating, so plan on spending an additional $34-182 per couple to sit next to each other based on location on the plane.The only issues we did have are the seats were very thin and worn out, uncomfortable in every sense of the word. We personally did not have carry-ons that needed to be stored in over head compartments, but both sold out flights made it very difficult for other patrons to find room for their belongings which made for a ton of confusion, so much so it took more than (30) mins getting off the plane in TPA on the flight home. Just a thought should anyone from AA read this, customers with only a personal item, and the ability to walk right off the plane without needing to wrangle around with over head compartments, and pushing luggage, should be prioritized and moved off first. That would drastically reduce the amount of people standing in the aisle causing congestion, to get off the plane quickly, and more room to drop items down and swiftly move off the aircraft for the remaining passengers."
"Very good service out of Tampa.  I have most of my points on American, so always check them first when traveling.  Very fortunate/lucky/blessed to be able to sit in the front of the plane.  Service was great. They have a very good merlot and Woodford Reserve is their go to bourbon.  Short flight so small meal.  I opted for the Cobb salad that got the job done."
"It's been a while since I've flown American into Tampa. A poor incident last Summer with the carrier had me pretty much abandon using them at all. This trip itinerary was Atlanta to Tampa and was delayed about 20 minutes with malfunction of some sort that required maintenance to inspect. No stars are being deducted as safety is the priority always.The flight offered beverage service but was cut off when there was turbulence. Again safety first, but sucked because I was really thirsty. I can't say it was not a good flight because we landed safely. Ultimate goal right? No issues, so I'm at a 4. However I don't go out of my way to book American these days. The poor reviews on this Yelp speak for themselves."
"We always prefer to fly American. Never had an instance of bad staffing. Planes are typically clean and given we have the AA card, we have access to their lounges which is a great escape from the typical airport crowds. WiFi available during flight via the AA site so you can watch movies or play games on your phone from their inflight selections."
"After more months of waiting and frustration, my wife and I have still not heard back from ""Customer Service"" nor the President of American Airlines, Robert.Isom@AA.com.   This is after more months of repeated requests for American Airlines to correct a very big mistake on their part.   Please stay away from American Airlines and let them continue to lead the industry in unhappy passenger satisfaction."
"American Airlines managed to cheat us out of $390 and 160,000 Aadvantage miles on flights that we had scheduled for this past June and July.   You should be very careful about expecting any kind of ""Customer Service"" from American.   They do not seem to know what customer service is supposed to mean.   They are only interested in their own service to themselves, not the customers who use them for flying betweeen destinations."
"I have just been through the most frustrating airline experience with American Airlines.   AA's CEO, and more importantly their ""Customer Relations"" department, are worthless.   They obviously only care about their bottom line, and are relying on their previously great reputation to blunt any criticism and responsibility for their short-comings.   I am never using American Airlines again.   I would advise you to also find another airline.   There are many of them, and the majority should give you a better trip for your dollars."
"American Airlines is ... not my favorite. Today was my first flight since COVID started, and I don't feel that they made me especially safe during the flight. One flight was completely packed. I get that they want to maximize their revenue. But when I boarded, they gave every passenger a sanitizing wipe to wipe down their seat. That was the full extent of the process to make us feel safe! (I mean, other than requiring masks and stopping beverage service on short flights, sigh.) The staff on the MIA to TPA this afternoon was completely rude and unhelpful. I'm sure everyone was tired. But the attitude from the male flight attendant was the worst I've seen on an airplane in years and years of both business and personal travel.My earlier flight today was about 50% full. Great. I was flying with my son, and when I picked our seats, we had the row to ourselves with the middle seat empty. Why did they put someone in the middle seat if the whole row across from us was empty? Why not put her in the middle seat there to reduce the close contact between strangers? I overheard several other people on the flight grumbling about the same thing. If Delta or Southwest are options with future travel, I'll go with them. American is not doing a great job with making its customers feel safe. And the service has been pretty rotten for years (at least if you're not flying business -- I'll grant that the business class is fine for an American airline)."
I can't believe American Airlines achieved a two star. I would like to give them a -2 star. I'm going to keep this short because I wasted enough of my time. Customer service sucks A$$
"This airline is the worst in customer service I have ever experienced.  On Nov 20 I boarded a flight from Sarasota Fl with a connection to Portland, Or.  Three hours later we are still sitting at the gate on the plane due to mechanical problems.  Because of this delay I missed my first connection so American booked me on a second connection which I also missed because we landed in Charlotte too late.  I needed to be in Portland the next morning for an important appointment.  They could not get me to Portland before the next evening.  I asked to get as close as possible so they flew me to Seattle.  They would not pay for a room for the night nor would they reimburse me for the train fare I had to pay to get to Portland.  When I complained to customer service they told me they would give me some miles-nothing close to the $1500 I spent for a first class flight.  Their business practices are less than admirable.  I will NEVER fly American again and warn those of you who do to be careful as they do not treat their passengers well."
"First time flying American. Had first class tickets together second row. First time flying first class. American moved us to the back of first class and separated us for a 5 hour flight. I will go back to the other airlines. American Airlines ratings are not the best in the industry. As an airline enthusiast and former pilot, I find this not first class by separating a husband and wife on a 5 our flight. Hope to get a refund."
"Stay away from this airline,  Horrible wait time and customer service once you get to talk to someone. Waited almost 2 hours just to check in for flight and agent was rude. Also lost my bag on my way into Tampa."
"No Stars if I Could ! Worst customer service ! DON't FLY AA ! OMG ! American Airlines received $5.2 Billion in bailout money and they can't answer the telephone or refund the money for a flight they canceled for No Reason! On May 16th the canceled my flight from Sacramento to Tampa! The hold time on the phone was 4 hours! They promised a call back, it never happened! Unable to re book a replacement flight on American, I had to book a flight on Southwest to get home! Over $400 one way!!!"
"We have all been frustrated with the Covid era, but American Airlines has managed to take advantage of this era and intentionally provide even worse service than it did before Covid. What's worse is their employees are consistently arrogant and disrespectful. If you are booking a flight, avoid this airline at all costs."
"The airline is getting better from my past experience. The line getting shorter for check because it is automated. The pre-check in also help since the confirmation help that you are traveling in 24 hour. I have selected my seat long before at booking. It secure where I want to seat. The earlier boarding help customers to settle down in the cabin. It also help if everyone is already boarded and the take off can be earlier. I got my flight 30 early due to faster flight and fully boarded and ready to go. It is very efficient for my flight today. After boarding, when they have too many empty economic premium seat, they redistribution the seat and create many 2 person in 3 seat and flight more enjoyable. The drink and snack serve on the plane. They dim the light entire flight because we have the evening 7 to 9 pm flight. It make relaxing during the flight."
I got here at 6 this morning for an international flight. When a pilot swapped his plane going to Philadelphia for a plane going to Miami with international connections. they made us go back down to the ticket service center. Get new tickets and back through security. I am traveling alone with a 10 month old and my current flight has been delayed twice. If it is delayed one more time I may miss my connecting flight from Miami. How thoughtless of the Pilot and everyone else who allowed this to happen. A $12 food voucher doesn't help much when the food is $20 of you are getting even a water with it. I  really hope American Arlines does better!!!!
"I know the industry had trouble with Covid. But my previous bad experiences were pre-Covid. There is a general lack of caring for the customers, and it is evident in the attitudes. My travel companion asked for coffee as did I, after the flight attendant served the coffee my date asked excuse me may have some cream, the attendant got an attitude and said "" we are here to protect You, not to serve you"". Later when the beverage service was done, it went to the rear of the plane to use the rest room. There 2 flight attendants at the rear, the closer I got I heard the one who copped an attitude about the cream complaining to the other flight attendant....it was about the nerve of a passenger asking for cream after she already served her coffee. She looks up recognizing me as the passenger next to the coffee cream passenger. She shut up and looked down. No time to for cream in a professional manner, but it is so important you complain 30 minutes later about it. 2 more incidents about general rudeness, and that's 3 strikes. Delta on all routes even if the layover is longer. I know a mechanic for AA he won't fly them either."
"American Airlines is absolutely terrible!! we had the worst experience we possibly could have. Our flight left early and we were at the gate 10 minutes before it was supposed to depart and they would not allow us on the plane. We were in customs along with 500 other people for two hours trying our best to get there as fast as possible. After not allowing us on our flight they then sent us to customer service where we wanted in line for two hours for them to tell us that the next flight isn't until the following day at 4:45pm and told us they would not be reimbursing us for our flight, Uber, or a hotel to stay in for the night. Not one single person apologized or tried to fix the problem. I guess it's okay for flights to leave early and then expect us to pay for a hotel, Uber and food??? makes sense right. absolutely terrible customer service. we ended up renting a car and driving 9 straight hours which we were not offered reimbursement for either. I will NEVER use American Airlines ever again."
"My flight home out of Tampa was cancelled twice and when I got to the airport there was a line for other cancelled flights. I stood in this line for 4 HOURS! And when I got  to the front of the line the lady basically told me that I wasted my time and I should just wait for the next flight. No voucher, no complimentary anything, no care in the world that a 19 year old has no where to stay for the next two nights"
"American a-holes. They did not allow me wearing an advanced mask for my protection. Instead they offered me the standard surgical rag . Upon me (politely and non-aggressively ) disputing this action a very unfriendly and grouchy captain had me escorted from the plane. He was all One-way communication. Macho airplane man!...;-). What a bunch of idiots...try to avoid if at all possible.The ordeal continued on the way back. 2 hrs delay due to a 'clerical' error on the manifest, followed by 'no ground crew available'. All the while I had to sit next to an anti masker with my poor replacement mask. Are these idiots out to kill me?"
Worst airline to travel with ever all because of the rude demanding employees and flight attendants it's ridiculous and sad how they are treating ppl after covid with kids. I brought a car seat on board for my 9 month old and have 2 other boys and was given such a hard time about the car seat being strapped in I wanted to cry and get the hell off the plane!! I had witnesses he was strapped in properly we get off the plane to only be greated by security and another liberal flight attendant male that was just reading us a structure of us failing to follow the rules when we did nothing wrong!!! He made us late to the other flight it was a disaster we were a peaceful family traveling w 3 kids and it was a nightmare this all happened in Phoenix twice already!!!!! I hope those 2 flight attendants get fired!! They are so rude didn't make flying easy for us will never fly American after this experience ever!!!!!!!!!!I would give zero stars if that was a option!
"I had a great experience at other terminals with American Airlines but like with anything, customer service at different locations vary. Tampa was not the best. But was not the worst. Meh."
I have points from flying with this airline. If you accumulate points they shouldn't expire but that's not the case. I go to use my points towards a trip and I can't use my points unless I have enough to cover the entire trip. So now I can't use my points and they're going to expire.
"Flew delta on way into Florida.   Spaces fliers out, felt safe. Gave hand sanitizer and a baggy with snack and water. Flying back to ohio on American. Every seat is booked, no snacks or water. No hand sanitizer. I will avoid American at all cost going forward."
I used American airlines to get to my mother's funeral in Charlottesville Virginia. When I got to Charlotte North Carolina and that off the jet I am disabled and they told me to sit on a bench and one of those mobile carts would pick me up. I had a connecting flight to Charlottesville. Then I waited 20 minutes and the cart never came. One finally came and I took to my gate. But there was no one in the boarding area. I asked an agent in another counter for American why couldn't I get on the jet? She said they closed the gates 20 minutes before the flight. I had never heard of that before and it wasn't my fault. I was able to get on another flight after waiting an hour but that made me late to my mom's funeral. I will never fly American airlines again.
Flying from Oakland to AZ then Tampa. We paid for nonstop and They changed it and we had to get on another plane in AZ to Tampa. It was super loud due to the landing gear for half an hour felt like I was on a Hawaii island hope planeReturn flight they did it again! We have to switch planes I believe we paid extra for not doing so!AND MORE PLANE ISSUES WTF!They could not boot up the plane computer after numerous attempts for over 45 minutes and we were going to switch planes.. oh but now it's working! Not feeling comfortable at all THEY SUCK and have OLD PLANES. I EILL NEVER FLY THEM AGAIN! We will most likely miss our connecting flight and they better not loose our luggage
Poor customer service. Ticketing and baggage lines move slowly. Kiosks work though and are easy to use.
"Yeah,  there are a couple of places to get a drink, food, etc.. ...BUT, they ain't got no plug-ins!In this day and age, not to have plug ins by the seats stinks. There is a small area that accommodates about 6 people as a work station,  and that's it!"
"Sorry, but the AA customer service is not that good here.I was taking a flight TPA - MIA - LAX - SAN . I asked , on checkin, to apply a SWU to the record. The lady checking me in had no idea how to do it. She calls support and they run her through the process - but she still couldn't figure it out.How many years has it been since the merger was finalized?After all these steps, she then says she cant check my bag as time elapsed. SERIOUSLY?AA needs to really retrain some employees here. This is getting very frustrating!"
"Absolutely the worst airlines in the sky today! I highly recommend using anyone else. The in flight staff is rude. They profile people. I wasn't personally profiled however I watched it happen. Plus they lost our luggage and have terrible support to recover the luggage! We were lied countless times. Hung up on, transferred and no one would do their job! They also choose to use a subpar luggage delivery service, Tampa conveyance. The gentleman I spoke to there was rude as well! Two days of lies! Plus horrible treatment of human beings! Do NOT use this airline."
"I have flown American Airlines many times and I hate giving anyone a bad review but I have had quite a few negative airline experiences and it's always with American Airlines sadly. This last time in Tampa a lot was happening I got to the airport a little over three hours earlier since my other family members had earlier flights and we had to drop off our rental. Long story short, there were several cancellations of flights happening. I happened to stand in the full service line right before a bunch of people had to come into the line to get rerouted. I had like five people ahead of me at the time and nearly waited an hour. Then finally was able to check in my things as well as my daughters. Then after we went through TSA. I wanted to grab something to eat  but since I had my daughters stroller and car seat I have to check it in at the gate. I decided to try to do that first. Unfortunately the flight before ours got cancelled so I had to stand in honestly the LONGEST line I had ever seen for a gate agent. I waited in the line for over an hour. Right before they were letting people from my zone to board they finally said we need to help those trying to get to Dallas. ( which were quite a few of us) I got helped and I was one of the last to board even though I had priority boarding. It was such a shame and honestly just a mess. So much chaos. I get things happened with flights but this happens a lot with American."
After working nonstop to be able to fly for New Years to see my family and friends.I was meeting a friend in NY for a day and a half to spend there. American Airlines decides to canceled my flight less than 12 hours before.Their explanations was because the plane of my flight was canceled at his first destination.They scheduled me for 2 days after and I changed it for the next day. I missed my day in NY..they whole reason I did this trip. Never getting a flight with American Airlines again!!
We've been very happy with the airline for our junkets between Tampa and Miami. The crew is always friendly and personable. We try to get premium economy on short flights to gain additional comfort room.
"It's a smaller a fairly limited Terminal overall. Saving grace is the fact that there are two coffee shops (Starbucks is one) as well as a lounge, if you have access. There are three restaurants which as is predictable force you to pay a massive markup for everything. Best news is that if you are running late, once you get thru security there isn't far to go."
"I haven't flown American Airlines in years.    Now I remember why I stopped.   You pay a high dollar for the flight times that work for you, then you pay a nice fee for checking baggage.   The personnel are very nice, but the planes do not move from location to location as they are supposed to.   While the customers arrive an hour early, queue up, and are ready to fly, the planes are not!TO VACATION:  the 1st leg of flight had a hydraulic leak, plane cancelled.   I got on the next flight to catch my connection.   The connection doesn't leave Charlotte because there's a storm.   Instead of delaying the flight by an hour, they cancel it.   Now I'm stuck in Charlotte overnight!    Finally arrive at my destination a day late.   A full day wasted.   RETURN HOME:    Take off from 1st leg of flight on time, connection in Philadelphia.   Plane on time, looks good.  Arrive in Philly, almost run to gate to catch my connection -- which happens to be at the most distant gate from where I landed.   I arrive 2 minutes before takeoff, planes already gone!!    They know I'm on one flight making connection -- oh, well, they left.   The next flight isn't for 4 hours and I'll arrive home after midnight!    I'm supposed to arrive by 3 PM, so big difference.   If I wanted a less expensive, multi-stop trip, I would have paid for it.    Now I sit and wait.   Do NOT fly this airline unless:  you have nowhere important to be, you have the time to sit around an airport, you have the desire to stay overnight in a city you don't want to be in, and you have the patience to accept an inferior flight management system.    The return flight home was an error on their part.   I booked this reservation through their system, they allowed me to book it knowing full well there is additional time needed to move from one gate to the other side of the airport for a different type plane.  American Airlines, please change your name!   You put the American name to shame with your terrible service.   You have lost me again, and I will be sure to advise all of my business associates and personal friends to beware."
