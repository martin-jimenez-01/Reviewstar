"I definitely have to give my experiences with them and it was definitely a solid ""okay.""  My flight was a bit delayed but I did get food on the flight so there was that.  The airport itself isn't very big so you're unlikely to get lost here.  Other than the delay, the flight itself was fine and they didn't lose my luggage so definitely got the service I expected to get."
"I'm trying to change my flight to a later date because I caught covid over the holidays. Their site lets me get all the way through the change process but when I click 'purchase' the site says ""please start over"". I have no pending charges, no confirmation emails. It gives no other information. So now I've been on hold for an hour and a half with no contact. Fix yourself American Airlines."
"We flew out of GSO on Sunday December 31st, 2017(8am) to DFW. The two flight attendants were rude & it made my flight very uncomfortable. One of them was telling almost everyone about there bags under the chair that if a little bit of the bag was sticking out they would trek at them. She would go up and down the isle a few times to make sure she would be heard.  She would make sure your phone was on airplane mode even though we were just sitting there waiting for everyone else.  The lady in front of me also said why are you so strict, you folks are really strict  today.?!?!Now because of that rude flight attendants I will never fly with American again.Even the guy checking you in was rude, he yelled at us because we didn't go up in time when he said if you want your bags to be checked in. He was mean and unfriendly.  I don't like to give negative reviews but people shouldn't be in a bad mood and treat people mean. But I won't fly American airlines ever again."
"My daughter and I flew to Puerto Vallarta recently. We were celebrating her college graduation and I splurged on first class tickets. Our first leg had a late departure because of a tornado in Dallas. By the time we landed there, the weather had cleared. American's cancellation of the next leg of our flight leads us to stay in a cheap hotel near the airport.  We forfeited a day in the expensive resort hotel. At baggage claim, American claimed to be unable to get our checked luggage. Medications were inside. The attendant bestowed upon us: ""Never leave prescription medication in checked baggage"". Our bags were in the basement and it would take from 1-5 hours to recover. We never saw our luggage the first night but spent hours waiting and on the phone arranging a new flight. Our first class tickets became economy aboard United the next day. At journey's end, we had two out of three bags. We found one shattered. The missing one stayed in the basement. It arrived the following night, 65 hours after check-in. The trip back home wasn't good either.  American switched my daughter and me to different flights without notice.  Some American employees were kind and empathetic. Many were rude and inconsiderate. At one baggage claim desk, we were not acknowledged. Most persons we talked to had one goal. Get these people out of here so I can go back to doing nothing or my phone. No reimbursement for any of our extra expense or inconvenience."
"American Airlines doesn't seem to be too concerned with customer service any longer.  I'm not sure how much blame can be put on the employees as they appear to be stretched too thin in Greensboro.  It won't be too much longer before everything is self service and flying is a commodity experience.  American is pretty close as it is.  While no airline is a pleasure any longer, most are preferable to American."
"I love me my American Airlines. Always on time, always a smooth ride and the staff is friendlier than other airlines.  Trying to get gold status by the end of the year. Keeping fingers crossed."
"I've been traveling a lot this year and most of my flights have been on American. 75% of my flights have been delayed. This isn't an anomaly. There is something wrong with a business that has a 75% fail rate. Earlier this year, flying from Austin to Charlotte, the flight was delayed. ""We are looking for a flight crew."" Really? Why wasn't there one scheduled. If you got to the grocery store and it was closed and there was a sign on the door that said, ""Sorry, we forgot to schedule enough staff to open today"", would that be acceptable? It got worse. Once they found a flight crew, the guy at the gate announces, ""We have another delay. We just realized the plane needs to be refueled and we are looking for fuelers."" Aren't these things scheduled well in advance? The latest incident was yesterday. It was my wife, not me. She was flying from Dallas to Austin. Delayed flight. No explanation. Over three hours pass with no updates, then, the flight in cancelled. She is given a voucher for a hotel, but no refund because she has been rescheduled for a flight leaving at 10pm the next day. Does that sound reasonable to anyone? She tries to rent a car, but none are available. She decided to give up and go to the hotel. American Airlines gave her a voucher to a hotel with no available rooms. She had to come out of pocket for a hotel and in the morning had to take the shuttle bus from Dallas to Austin. Yes, American Airlines, people have jobs and can't wait until 10pm to get home. Horribly disappointed in your service. You have issues that start at the highest level of management and they trickle down throughout your organization. Do you even care about your customers, those who are paying your salaries. Never issues on Southwest, Delta, or even Jet Blue."
"The staff was pleasant,  however, letting customers know they need to print boarding pass for pre check would have saved me the agro pat down from the GDP TSA cronnies"
"Horrible experience.  Melanie, our flight attendant was unaccommodating and rude. She made the boarding experience, flight and exiting the plane period unenjoyable.  I will never fly this airline again and would encourage others to follow suit if they value professionalism and courteousness out of their air lines."
"The gate agents are rude, arrogant and tell lies to charge extra baggage fees to customers.  These are the WORST agents I have seen in regards to customer service...and I fly almost weekly...filing complaints with American Airlines customer care center produced nothing but more aggravation after they sent me copies of their customer service policies, which their agents obviously do not follow.  I encourage you to fly with someone else...I'm going to.  Sadly, my dad is retired from American Airlines, and it is NOT the airlines I remember flying...."
"Worst flight experience ever! Flight was scheduled at 7am, they let us know at 7:15am that the crew was missing. Re-scheduled a flight for 8:48am but it interfered with our connecting flight so we had to get a new flight. Took 1.5 hours to get us a new flight mostly from poor communications between workers and workers avoiding you, not wanting to help. We were then given tickets for a new flight but they had accidentally scheduled us for the wrong flight. So we had to wait an additional 15 minutes to get the right tickets once again. Then got in a car and had to drive another 1.5 hours to get to a new airport where our new flight was. Once we got there the new flight was delayed by a couple hours! We were never offered compensation for paying for parking at the first airport as well as gas to get us to the second airport. In fact we were pretty much told sucks to be you! Avoid flying American Airlines, United Airlines or US Airways if you can!"
"Our trip was originally scheduled for SF to DFW (Flight # 2417), and DFW to GSO (# 5812) in North Carolina. Flight from SF to DFW departed and landed with no complications. Original leave time for flight #5812 on Sunday was to depart at approximately 8:30, to land in GSO at 11:05. Our troubles began when the gate changed from B47 to B1 with no notice or confirmation. The only reason we found out was from a non-airport flight tracker web site. Waiting at B1 with the rest of the people scheduled to take the flight, our gate was then changed again, back to B47 with no confirmation or notification from the airport. At this time the gate personnel at B1 still had no idea. The only reason we found out, again was from a non-affiliate web site. After running to the gate at the other end of the airport with 5 minutes to spare, (this because the Sky Link was broken) we made it to B47. At B47 there was no Gate attendant, only a message on the screen informing us that the flight would depart at the scheduled time. As we watched the scheduled time come and go, again with no gate attendant in sight the screen changed again with a later departure time, still no gate attendant at this time. After 2 hours a non-related flight attendant traveling with our group answered the ringing phone, to inform the control center that there was no gate attendant, no pilot, no crew, and that the plane had been sitting there since when we first arrived. About 5 minutes later the supervisor showed up. She was unresponsive to anyone's questions, and refused to talk to anyone. She got on the phone a few times, typed in the computer and we watched the departure time change again. Only this time is was changed to 11:00, which was the same time as another scheduled flight. These people were also now at the gate and as confused as we were (because the airport flight screens said both our flights would be leaving at the same time, from the same gate). We finally got word that we were waiting on a crew, and we watched a pilot and two stewardesses board the plane. Again, no notice from any gate personnel. After we watched the now changed 11:30 departure time come and go, we watched the pilot and two stewardesses de=board the plane. Still no one at our gate to answer any questions, as the supervisor had left hours before.  We asked the pilot and stewardesses what was happening and they responded that they had been sitting on the plane for too long, and were now over their hours. They also informed us once they walked away there was no one to fill their spots, and the flight would inevitably be cancelled. Again no notice from the screen that still said it was departing at 11:30, which at this time it was 12:30. At this time I split up from my fiancée, and headed toward the re-booking counter, counting on the obvious and remember the long lines we saw earlier. As I waited in the re-booking like (with no one attending) located at gate B41, people in line were telling me that the attendant that was there stated she had worked 11 hours, and she was done. Following that she walked away, leaving no-one at re-booking. While waiting in line, I saw the supervisor again. Only this time she was stopped by the Airport Police who informed her that she was going to be documenting what was happening. She explained to the supervisor what had happened with the re-booking agent walking off, and the supervisors response was, ""What do you want me to do about it? I have been here for 11 hours too."" The airport police stated, she too had been there for many hours, but someone needed to help the people in inline. That they couldn't just be left there with no way to re-book. With no response the supervisor then walked away from the Airport Police. This Airport Police woman needs to be commended. She was a shorter woman, with brown hair and blonde highlights, working around gates B41-B47 on Sunday night. Giving re-booking advice was obviously not her job, and she was doing her best to help a bad situation. I watched her help about 45 people individually trying to answer their questions and guide them to the best alternative. This alternative for us was finding another booking agent at another gate. On behalf of my family, my fiancée's family, and anyone who will listen to this story I am going to put on blast throughout any social media, American Airlines will never get our business. I refuse to pay thousands of dollars, and be made to feel the way we were treated. It's one thing to be delayed due to weather, its one thing to have flights canceled, but to have your employees make us feel like pawns in your monopoly is ridiculous."
"I booked three months out, with forward seating assignments. Two months later they changed one the longest legs of my flight to Alaska with last row seating assignment! I was told by both Airlines that I can not change seats until pre-checkin. I call Alaska, one seat 6 rows forward, but I have to do it on line... 2 min later seat gone. F'American for not putting their customers first. When they first changed the flight plenty of seats were available forward in the cabin."
