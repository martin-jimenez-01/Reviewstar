"It has been almost 5 years since I flew American last time. Also, my experience this time was quite different: terrible. So, a review update is appropriate.I rarely fly American, but I had to use them this time to go home early during the 2022/2023 Southwest ""meltdown."" ""First-Class""During online checkin, I purchased a first-class upgrade since it was only $92 (between LAX and Seattle). With a baggage fee ($30) included, I thought $92 was not bad at all; $62 for a larger seat and a free meal and drinks during a 3-hour flight. However, the meal was a joke. It was a box of snacks (see my photo)! I know it's a first-world problem, but I was picturing something so much better, an actual meal served on plates. At least, that's what I always expect and get on Alaska. Yes, it was operated by Skywest, but if it carries your brand, you should do a better job!Check inThe agent at the checkin counter (LAX Terminal 5) was an extremely unfriendly, grumpy, middle-aged man. I'm sure it's not always a pony ride to deal with customers, but you can be a bit nicer, at least ""not unpleasant.""VerdictAs a university professor, I have to assign you a course grade, American Airlines!

"I know, I know! I couldn't believe it myself. When I flew to NYC a couple years ago, it was absolutely terrible! This time (March 2018), it was a completely different experience. Food:I was dreading to fly on American because it's a long flight to NYC and I was in the main cabin. I couldn't believe it, but they fed us and it was free! They even gave us two options to choose from. I chose the cheese platter, and it was very decent.Fleet and Entertainment:The fleet was much newer and cleaner this time. We had individual screens even in the main cabin. It may not sound  anything too special, but given that there were no individual monitors on my American flight to NYC a couple years ago, this is huge. Beside, on my return flight, I took Alaska back. There were no individual screens. They were renting out tablets for $10! I love Alaska, but shame on you! I rarely fly American. So, this could be an isolated case. So, I don't want to be carried away and give them 5 stars, but I think they deserve 4 stars based on this specific flight I took to NYC.******************************If you found something useful in my review, please hit ""useful"" so that I can improve my reviews.

Awful airline. 6 hr delay and not even a meal voucher. You can top it off with an AWFUL customer relations service. Fly Delta.Your online complaints will not be answered and when you call they tell you to reach customer service online.
"This was supposed to be a holiday family trip to Belize that cost approximately $15,000. This trip turned out to be the worst trip and will go down in my family as the Belize Horror Trip of 2022. The culprit and the root of all our problems? You guessed it. American Airlines. December 23rd was when we arrived at the airport to be greeted by astronomically long lines and freezing temperatures. After this, we were shuttled onto the plane and were on our way to Belize.In Belize, we found out that no one's bags on our flight were in Belize. They were exactly where we left them last, at the Dallas airport. We had no idea when we would receive our bags with AA customer service stating that they would give us tracking info on our bags and that it would be in Belize within 24hrs. We were essentially stranded with nothing but whatever we had in our carry ons. One day wouldn't be a huge deal we thought. I have a medical condition that requires the use of an inhaler or else I am at risk of being unable to breathe. That inhaler was in the luggage that had been stranded in Dallas. I only had an emergency inhaler on me. So, I started making calls with AA only to be put on hold for hours on end and receiving false hope and deceptive responses to our questions. They let us know that our bags will be in Belize but at this point, its Christmas eve.The next day on Christmas, still no word of our belongings. All my dad had were flipflops and chapstick. We had no clothes and no toiletries and had to resort to buying a few items in Belize. My inhaler was running low and I had to start rationing the medication in it. None of the pharmacies there had the prescription as you can only get it in the U.S. Christmas day we call again and once again, nothing but terrible customer service and lies. We were at our wits end and wondering what was happening with everyone else whos baggage was left in Dallas who were on the same flight as ours. How does an entire airplane's worth of luggage just get forgotten about? Well, we find out from someone on the other line of AA customer service that they decided NOT to load the luggage onto our plane or else there wouldve been delays. IS IT NOT BETTER TO BE DELAYED BUT HAVE OUR LUGGAGE WITH US FOR CHRISTMAS??????? How is it logical that they came up with that decision without informing the passengers who paid for the trip and are taking NO responsibility for this? OH RIGHT. To secure the money from the oblivious passengers on the flight. Its the day after christmas now and we are absolutely livid and are going to forgo the rest of the trip and the $15,000 that was spent on it to schedule a flight back to Dallas for our bags. My inhaler was running out and I needed to take the medication. We call AA and after being on hold for 11 hours, we finally get through to let the person on the other side know that we are scheduling a flight back to Dallas the next day and to NOT move the bags or deliver them to Belize. They respond by saying, ""Oh, don't worry. We had NO INTENTION of moving these bags."" Well THANKS for letting me know that you had no intention of moving our bags that you have held hostage for 4 days now.Now here comes the best part of this story. We take the flight back to Dallas, still with nothing and our sanity nearly reaching 0 and guess what? We are told that our bags have been shipped to Miami. Are you kidding me? They were told NOT to move our bags. I need the inhaler thats in the bag to breathe. They said they had no intention of moving the bags at all and now they are sent the opposite direction of Belize to MIAMI????????? Who in their right mind is allowing these decisions at AA??? Now we will not be receiving our bags for what I estimate, a couple of months. We are stranded in Dallas and our option is to rent a car and drive all the way back to where we live, which is Las Vegas, Nevada. An 18-hour drive back home, our luggage with medical devices as well as electronics across the continent and all because of American Airlines and their negligence as well as terrible customer service. THANK YOU for making our Holiday Vacation the WORST TRIP EVER American Airlines."
"The massive amount of one star reviews is not surprising.  It is the same on the Better Business Bureau website. I have spent an exhausing amount of time trying to unsuccessfully get meaningful consideration for problems on my last two flights.  In July, I purchased a first class ticket and was called forward by the gate agent that I would be bumped and a representative would call me back to reconcile??  this was certainly stressful.  It was even more stressful when no one called me back because the flight then became delayed and everyone flooded the desk for flight changes.  Since I was told I would be bumped I dealt with it electronically to book another flight, but then AA would not honor their policy on bumping passengers.Next, this past October, I was offered an opportunity to upgrade to first class.  I accepted and (1) even printed my boarding pass showing a first class seat.  But the app showed my original seat.  (2) I proactively tried to reconcile with AA reps, who assured me I would have a first class seat.  (3) The morning of my flight I received a text message telling me I was in first class.  Guess what, when I got to the gate, and showed (1) my boarding pass, (2) my text message of my seat assignment , and (3) insisted the gate agent pull up the notes from the night before that I would get a first class seat.  All I got was a snarky reply from the agent who shoved a card with an 800 number for me to call to get this sorted out.  Even with all of my evidence, complaints to several escalated levels of customer service, a complaint to the BBB, and Dept of Transportation, all I got was miles, which hardly offset the cost of my time and embarrassment.  Oh the AA customer rep service said they don't compensate customers for embarrassment.  ** Being humiliated by the gate agent is free ; - )  ***  What I requested was that the upgrade be honored on a future flight (which I had already booked) between the same origin and destination but apparently this was impossible for AA. In my mind, the invitation to use the miles to fly again so I could have another ?#!?##!! experience.  How generous !!!Look we are all on the same boat.  We often have little choice in some cases since airlines operate as mini monopolies between certain cities.  My only suggestion if you are like me ** ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore!! "" (See the 1976 movie ""Network,"" if you don't get the reference : - ) ) ***Consider writing your elected representatives and asking for improvement of airline operations.*I think part of this revolves around stopping the government from allowing anymore mergers and encouraging more competition, if you want airlines to truly value us as customers.*We need to be able to truly leverage the power of competition if the government will not reinstitute contracts of carriage that better protect the consumer.  As general advise, I've gotten to the point of leaning more on Delta even if it costs a little more and taking a little longer.  Delta, IMO, seems to at least be slightly more interested in customer service, but it is hardly a cure all or a profile in excellence either.**I hope you will join me and start demanding our elected representatives start working more for change and letting the benefits of the free market help us consumers again, instead of being forced to keep accepting terrible  customer service!**"
"Could be one of my last flights on American if they do not get their act together.Got screwed out of a Business Class seat on my return flight home, the inbound flight that arrived into LAX sat on the runway for 45 minutes awaiting a tow to the gate and now my return flight home is delayed. No food available for sale on the plane during a 5+ hour flight. Definitely appears Spirit Airlines has taken over American."
I flew first class on a flight from JAN to CHA. The 'first class' on this flight was a joke. Their flight attendants could use a retraining on putting customers first. They seem to have a problem with certain races flying first class.
"I took American Airlines for my flight from Nashville to SFO. There weren't many direct flights for this route so I opted to go for American Airlines since it had one of the cheaper prices for the earlier arrival time in SFO. My flight from Nashville to LAX wasn't bad at all. The plane was new, clean and it was pretty fully. No issues with placing my bag on top for carry on and the overall flight in the air and landing/takeoff was very smooth. The seats were a decent size for economy. I was actually very surprised but how smooth it was and thought to myself, why haven't I taken American more often? Well... I figured out why. My flight from LAX to SFO was the complete opposite experience I had with my other flight. Yes given, it was a smaller plane to fly this route so most likely the smoothness would not be the same. Which is fine in that case. However, this plane was super dirty like nobody bothered to clean it for one and the seats were definitely tighter than the previous plane. Not only that, as I am sitting there waiting for takeoff, I feel these little ice specks come out from somewhere above my head. I figured it was just a small thing, but as we sit there longer, it kept coming out of the AC vent. Is this normal? Probably not. I am not sure if the whole plane experienced this but the 2 in front of my row and the guy next to me definitely did. I never experienced anything like this on my other flights with Southwest, United or Alaska. I may give them another chance but honestly I am not sure if I will."
Absolutely horrible  it was 80° on the plane we will never fly american american again. We literally developed a heat rash during our flight.  We asked the flight attendants to lower the temperature and they never did. Everyone on the flight was sweating.  It was horrible horrible. Worst flight ever
"This airline is inept.  I tried to schedule a flight to Miami, FL from Newark, NJ on January 26th at 5 am and returning on the same day at 7:35 pm, and I was booked for the wrong day."
"After a wonderful vacation of deep sea fishing...stuffed 2 coolers and packed on block ice. Airline said no fresh fish packed in ice....must be frozen. Ridiculous. How the are you supposed to get home fresh fish, crab, and shrimp...if you gotta freeze it. Might as well bought frozen fish from Kroger's. Shame on you american airlines.....with such a bad review score you'd think they try harder"
"Only thing I can say positive is that we got to our destination.  Coming back was another story.  Our roundtrip tickets sent us to Reagan National instead of Richmond where our car was.  When we discovered the error, American personnel were rude and condescending snd unhelpful.   We had to rent a car for $200 to make it home, then drive to Richmond the next day to get the car.  Will never fly with this airline again!"
"#AmericanAirlines The rumors are true! LAX to DCA trip so far;1. Captain's seat not working. Walked across #LAX like a herd of cattle to get to another plane.2. Second plane delayed further without explanation.3. Now in Charlotte NC. 3rd plane delayed without explanation. 2 hours.4. Flight cancelled. 4th plane - projected delay 2 - 4 more hours because DCA ( Washington DC Reagan Airport ) is under storms and such. Deplane. Waiting in airport.5. 5th plane. Announcements made stating that this plane has mechanical difficulties on top of it and they are rescheduling everyone for later flights.After hearing about this in the news and from friends, I decided to get myself one day cushion for American Airlines dysfunctionality. 6. Plane 6. A cattle drive to another gate. Then another.1 hour wait.7. Plane 6a. The captain gets on the mic and tells us that he does not have a flight officer and American airlines is not providing him with one. So we will need to wait for him to find a co-pilot and he said it will be up to two more hours.This is amazingly bungled.All I wanted to do was fly from LAX to DCA...The saga continues."
"11 hour delay in Miami due to no pilot. Put bags on plane for 9 pm departure, and would not remove them to switch flight. Did not give hotel voucher until midnight so I slept in the airport due to new 8 am departure and hotel that was 14 MILES away. $12 meal voucher. I complained so they gave me 5000 points, which is equivalent to 1/5 of a short domestic flight. Absolutely terrible. Leaving this airline. It's just getting worse and worse. Fly Delta. Totally terrible customer support in airport, including he next day when the crew simply told us they were not part of the thing that happened the previous day. You can tell by their reaction that they do this all the time. Leaving American for Delta."
"Airline lost my checked bag that contained all my COPD medications. I got the runaround for the first 5 days including being hung up on several times. Finally, submitted claim and AA says too bad so sad and that it will take 45 days to process claim. Medicaid refuses to replace medications and tell me it must be out of pocket. I don't have $2000 to pay for lost inhalers. was finally given someone ( Latrez Clemmons) to actively work on my claim and when I asked him to expedite claim because I need my inhalers he hung up on me and now will not answer or return my calls."
"Husband has had 4 retinal detachment surgeries since 10/19/22.  @Americanair, despite receiving a surgeon's letter stating he CANNOT fly, will not extend the expiration date of our flights. $2200 lost because they don't care that flying could result in permanent blindness. So, @Americanair states that flying that could cause blindness is not a medical exemption. We aren't making an excuse; just following surgeon's orders.  We have been loyal to @Americanair but after denial will have to fly other airlines."
This airline has gone to the dark side.  No customer service and they won't  even talk with you about anything.My flight was delayed 12 hours and they handled it poorly. Won't be flying this cattle car anymore.
"Customer service sucks. Across the board though it seems as if customer service everywhere is fall short with many employees thinking they can be rude and abrassive in ""tone"" and how they speak to paying customers. Today I am flying with American to get home and the just shuffled the seats around. I need to be in a window seat since, while I fly for work, I still have a slight fear of flying so it helps to be able to look out. Well I wasn't just assigned a different row but a different seat so I went to ask politely it it was still a window seat and the flight attendent at the counter used a very abrasive tone when she responded with they just moved people up. Im sorry ma'am but if that was the case I wouldn't have needed to ask in the first place. I told her it was a simple question and she didn't need to be rude about it and she became even more rude telling me that's just her tone. Well maybe she needs to work that out and come off kinder while at work. Because no. You were very rude. Do better american."
"I have been through many airports around the world and I must say my most recent experience at this AA location was amazing. I swear that from the time that my uber dropped me off at the curb, I was up in the American Airlines Admirals Lounge in anout than 10 minutes. At least it seemed like it.  As soon as my Uber driver handed me my luggage from the trunk, the curbside check in was open and I handed over my luggage. Since I had already checked in on my app and had a free check-in luggage, that interaction was only a hot minute. I took the elevator to TSA PreCheck and no one was there, so I went right on through and into the lounge. It was amazing to say the least!I will say that what makes it easy to breeze into the airport very quickly is probably the time of day, using the AA app, have TSA Pre Check, and a free check-in luggage.  If you have all of those ducks in row, you should be having your cocktail in the lounge within 10 minutes!"
"Absolutely the best airline around. Excellent customer service, good track record, newer aircrafts and experienced and friendly flight crew. I've been flying American exclusively (as much as I can) for many years and have millions of miles with them as a result. They have an excellent rewards program and I actually look forward to my trans-con flights. Well done American Airlines! The Flagship Check In is exceptional as is the Flagship Lounge in Terminal 4."
"Absolutely terrible! AA changed the flights so often that we had to fly into another airport because from our original arrival time of afternoon, they had our group of six arriving too late at night. The price of the original Al flight went down over $500 with the new fllight, and They owe me money and when I said I'd report them when they wouldn't give my money back, they said, ""Go ahead."" I fly 7 or so times a year, mainly with Lufthansa, Alaska, Southwest, and United, and will likely stick to airlines that care more about customer experience."
"I'm upping my original review because of a ticket agent who knows what great customer service should be.I saw in the AA app that there was an earlier flight that was open so I booked it.  When I tried to check in, the app froze.  I tried a couple more times and nothing.Worried that I got screwed yet again by AA, I headed to the gate as soon as someone was manning the front desk.  I don't know her name, but it was flight 851 with service from LAX to Philadelphia.  I told her my situation and she calmly checked our status and checked us in.  She realized that my daughter and I weren't seated together so she... drum roll please... worked on getting us seated together by moving some unsuspecting person from one aisle seat to another.  I repeat, she did this without me having to ask. I tear up just thinking about the amount of empathy she must of had for me to have thought... you know what? They should be sitting together.That made this whole AA ordeal not so bad.  Like they say in sports... you can't teach hustle... and she HUSTLED!  If AA could just clone her and get input from her on company policy, they would not be languishing on Yelp with 2 stars."
"I know everyone has experienced a delay.  And I understand it's almost expected for any airline, but what sets airlines apart is the way they treat their guests when one does arise.  We were flying from San Jose to Philadelphia with one stop in LAX.  The turn around was about an hour.  Unfortunately, our San Jose flight was delayed for some ""minor"" repair.  15 minutes max, they told us.  After 15 minutes, they said another 15 minutes.  So we started to get worried. I went to ask about the connecting flight and they said there was nothing to worry about if we leave in the next 15 minutes.  We were boarding 15 minutes later.  They said it was going to be easy to laid everyone in.  But they didn't take all the big carry-in's to check in.  So I guess with these smaller planes, the overhead storage can't accommodate even the smallest roller bags.  So we spent what felt like forever trying to get everyone to check in their bag that couldn't fit.Then, when at LAX, we needed to ride a bus to the terminal.  Long lines... no chance we get there in time... and of course we miss the flight.  Then we have to find a ticket agent to book a later flight.  Everyone is too busy, because they have another flight... so we get passed around.  I finally just call customer service to rebook a flight.  That was the easiest part of the experience.Then I go and ask for a food voucher because our flight is now 11:20pm.  It was 2:30pm at the time of me rebooking. Yeah, 9 hours.When I finally get an agent, they can't do vouchers... so off we were again to another agent.Poor customer service, poor communication.  Poor experience over all.  Disappoint d and frustrated with the airline.  I will try to avoid at all cost."
"American Airlines takes advantage of their own inability to service their customers. I originally booked a flight to Mia for $276 on December 24rd (Friday 12AM Red Eye). However, leading up to that, I change my flight to leave on the 21st and pay an additional $252 for the change which I accepted ($528 in total). On my way to the airport they cancel my flight for the 21st due to staffing issues. I scramble to book a new flight and as expected nothing that they are showing me is going to work. However, as a double check, I look online and see another Red Eye for Thursday at 10:30PM which is essentially what I started with. I try to call in, and the phone lines are backed up for hours. I go online and confirm, the 10:30PM flight I want is not listed in my rescheduling options. I have no choice but to cancel my ticket of $528 and rebook a new ticket to the value of $528 (A curious value)So long story short, I am out a day at my hotel now, a day less with friends and family, and I paid an additional $252 to take the same flight I booked previously (2 hour difference)I submitted a claim for partial refund describing the situation and as one might expect it was denied. Thanks American Airlines!"
"O stars! AA allowed me to fly across the country with my dog. Then, when it's time to return they tell me no the dog is to big for the crate. (Smallest dog I saw in the airport). Left me stranded across the country with absolutely no help. Just a, get out of the way, not our problem, response. I went right over to Delta, the dog was fine and they got me a flight home. Unfortunately that cost me $1000.00 which of course American Airlines isn't going to help me with. Oh, maybe a credit, as if I would use them again. The dog that was supposedly to crammed is pictured in her bag below."
We have now been stopped by our gate after landing at lax for 1hr and nobody seams to care I will never fly American again because of this experience my time is not free
"We spent 27 hours accosted in Saint Lucia after our flight was delayed. The airport staff was incredibly incompetent, don't care and straight up lied to us at times. There's dirty visqueen literally just stapled to the ceiling. The food is mediocre at best, very limited and incredibly expensive. The outside looks like it's been to war. There's no where to plug your phone. The WiFi is slower than a snail. They put passengers in hotels that had no running water and blood on the sheets. Then gave us $12 food vouchers that wouldn't even purchase a full meal. We spent $34 on Chex mix and sodas. No smoking area and denied exit after 12 hours sitting around. They had a pregnant woman, young children and elderly people sitting around on plastic airport chairs for a full day. After 27 hours of being stuck there, and most of it sitting in a terrible airport, the crew comes prancing out for the final time after refusing to fly all this time due to ""maintenance issues"". Mind you, everyone can see the plane the whole time and NO maintenance is occurring. No one went near the plane. They turned around and started walking away for about the fourth time when they were approached by several furious passengers. Then comes ""Captain Sam"" (who portrays the hero) and 10 minutes later we're boarding the SAME PLANE that's allegedly having maintenance issues! Once on the plane, I heard the first and ONLY apology from the flight crew. They profusely apologized over and over. Thanks. Apologies were meaningless. We want compensation for that. Horrible experience. We will not be returning to Saint Lucia because of the airport staff and American Airlines. That experience ruined our honeymoon and Mother's Day."
"First and last time I will ever fly American Airlines. I booked our flight 6+ months ago for my husband and I to celebrate our anniversary. Late the night before -when we were already asleep because our flight was at 6am- they sent out an email canceling our flight and rebooking us on a later one. We didn't see the email until our car service had already picked us up and we were on the way to the airport at 4am. We had to wait for four hours for our new flight. My husband upgraded us to first class on the original flight which they were unable to fulfill on the rescheduled flight.  We were told to dispute the charge so he could get his money back.We board the plane just to wait for almost an hour and a half to take off because it had ""water pressure issues in the restroom"". We missed our connecting flight and had to go on an entirely new plane. I asked for refund because I rather get my money back and go fly with literally anyone else but the lady who was assisting us told me I would have to figure it out how to get my money back through the reimbursement page.Now we are waiting on our connecting flight that is going out over an hour after it was supposed to.I've had to reschedule our rental car plus cancel dinner I planned for my husband because now we aren't getting there until almost 7pm when we were originally supposed to be there at 11:40am if our original flight was honored. Absolutely ridiculous. I will never fly American again."
"Its OST (One Star Tue) again!!!!!There is a take on an old proverb that says, getting there is half the battle.  However in AA's case, getting there is a constant battle.  For example, fr LAX to MIA, they changed the terminal once and the gate 3x.  I thought they changed the terminal again after I looked at the screen, but found out there was no Gate 40 in the other terminal.  It was a long fukn walk back and I was sweating my ass off.To add insult to injury, the flight was delayed 1 1/2 hrs.  During the flight a couple of passengers were so fukn rude.  One guy kept getting up to get shit out of his luggage and bumping into me w/ his ass.  After the third time I said, ""Que carajo?"" (WTF?).  He finally apologized.  Nonetheless, he went into his luggage at least 3 more times and bumped into me every time.  The other fukhead kept letting his kid kick my chair.  Additionally, his kid was screaming most of the flight.  Pro tip: Give your kid a little cough med and it lets them sleep.  Be considerate to other passengers mthrfukr!!!!!  Lastly, upon arrival MIA, it is a long fukn walk to exit, there are no clear signs how to get to ground transpo, nor where to get a Lyft.The return trip wasn't w/o its issues.  There were at least 3 passengers wearing their masks below their mouths.  A flight attendant told the one two seats over fr me she was going to write him up, bc it was his second warning.  Like the ass that he is, he said, it was the first time.  He also said, its always the fat ones:  Dude!!!!  Look in the mirror.  He continued to leave his mask off for most of the flight.  Same goes for this other ass I reported to an attendant.  He complied, and then kept his mask off for most of the flight.  Fuk all three of you entitled mthrfukrs endangering other passengers!!!!!I stopped flying AA a while ago bc they stopped crediting actual miles for their Dis-Advantage frequent flyer program.  For example, LAX to MIA is approx 5,500 miles round trip.  The total miles I earned round trip to MIA is 1,750 miles:  WTF?!?!?!?!?!After this nightmare of a pair of flights, there is no fukn way I am flying AA again:  Add AA to my ATJAAC list!!!!!"
"American Airlines is by far the worst airline I've traveled on. Very poor customer service, terrible leg space, cancellations all too common, just some of the things that are hideous about American. Today, the lady checking me in intimidated me into paying 100 dollars for overweight baggage(by a few pounds). It might be their policy to charge a flat fee for the extra weight, however, the way she talked was quite messed up. That was extra polite to the white guy just ahead of me, and downright rude to a POC(me) shows how much work American still has to do when it comes to training their staff about racial bias. I'll try and not fly American now onwards."
"This is not a complaint about a missing bag - things happen and I understand that. This is a complaint about the headache and poor customer service options that exist SHOULD AA misplace your bag.  I have invested over 7 hours over two weeks sitting on hold and have never once been able to speak to a live person at Central Baggage.  I have made a claim and submitted receipts online. I have an incident number (TULAA85820144) on behalf of a Rabbi who lives in Israel and came to visit us last month. Their bag never arrived and was missing for the duration of their stay (5 weeks). We did everything we were supposed to do and have heard NOTHING back from AA as to the claim. We just want to confirm the process, check the status and have the refund check sent to the correct person.  We have visited the Tulsa Airport AA Bag Claim office several times and they state they cannot help us or access the case/file from their computers. We have been calling 817-786-4333 per their direction and have made no live human contact. There isn't an email. There isn's a webform. There isn't ANY help or resource for us.  We are extremely disappointed and wish to caution others before choosing American Airlines ... not because they may lose your bag - ANY airline may lose a bag.... but be warned that IF American Airlines loses your bag, you will have little to now support or access to help through customer service.  It is tragic in this day and age with automation and technology not to have systems in place to provide gateways of communication for customers to get assistance with their problems. I would be satisfied if they told me it would take 6 months to resolve - I understanding staffing shortages. I understand the issues the airlines have been having. I just want SOMEONE to tell me SOMETHING about this claim and give me some comfort and feedback.  I type this as I am waiting on hold for my 7th hour...."
"This by far has been the most horrible experience I've had and it was my honeymoon. My connecting flight from MIA to LAX was closed as customs and immigration took almost 2 hours. The flight was supposed to leave at 917p but we got to the gate at 904p and they refused to board us. We had to wait in line for another hour to rebook for a flight that leaves the following morning at 7 without any meals or hotel accommodations. To top it off, my baggage was damaged and when I spoke to the baggage service rep she refused to provide a claim number and told me to follow up within 7 days. I chatted with an AA agent after getting home and now they are requiring me to go back to an airport to have my baggage inspected even though an AA baggage rep at LAX reviewed it and didn't offer any help or direction. You guys lack accountability in every possible way and I'm disappointed in your customer service. Try any other airline if you want a decent experience"
Flying from Cleveland to Charlotte then on to Aruba.  Got on the plane taxied out of the gate waiting to take off. Pilot announced that they had de-icing issues and had to return to the gate to get a mechanic to look at it. Came back on and told us we had to get off. Told us this was a RECURRING ISSUE  on this plane. Now have to wait 10 hours for the next flight and are gong to miss a day in Aruba. Really feel sorry for the people going on cruises that are going to miss the ship. Shady business practices.  NEVER FLY AGAIN.
"Avoid at all costs, expensive flight...cheap planes and experience!  Horrible customer service on all fronts.   What a let down!"
"Never again. The most unprofessional and inconsiderate staff. I booked a flight and then couldn't fly because of covid. Staff said its my fault I lost the credit because the trip was an economy flight and it was only $200. ""She cant help me because its only $200."" Whether its $200 or $2000, you should treat customers with respect and try to find solutions. At this time its not about the money, its really about the service."
