Never had a problem with American Airlines at the EWR airport in New Jersey. Customer service is always friendly and helpful. Never a line to check bags. I've had nothing but a great experience with American Airlines!
4-21-22 and 4-23-22Flew MIA to EWR and returned two days later EWR to MIA American is my preferred airline. The choices for me this trip was Spirit from FLL 10 minutes from my house or American from MIA 1 hour away. Last minute flight so going window seat back of plane more people than should legally be allowed. Yes mask mandate is over but I left mine on so I wouldn't have to smell the passenger next to me. Also love the new snack instead of the biscoff cookies which I am sick of a nice nut mix which included pecans. Returning left late as we were waiting on a crew member but surprisingly enough landed half hour early in MIA. That flight there was only 70 something passengers so I got my own row to sleep.Thank you American for being a constant that I can count on.
"Hellllll no. Don't take this airline from Newark. Security line is around the terminal, then they don't even tell you that you can go into the other empty security line and take a shuttle. I'm sure people missed their flight over the poor logistics management at TSA. Also, everyone is sooo so rude. You can tell they're all miserable. Just a bad experience all the way around."
"The absolute worst airlines on the planet. Delays , rude and unavailable . Sat on the plane for 3 plus hours and they didn't even offer water ? 7 hours wait on the phone, the app doesn't work and  unwilling to help on every level . As a 1K world traveler , I've tried them all and without question, they are at the bottom ."
"Traveling from Newark, NJ to Phoenix Arizona via American Airlines was easy. It was a full flight but lines moved quickly and efficiently. I like that they had assigned seats so being next to last to board didn't matter to me. The staff was very nice and accommodating. One thing I would have liked is them letting us know an area we were in. We traveled over some really interesting looking places and I would have loved to know where. I also took a star away because there was NO WIFI for the entire 5 hour flight. I had my book with me so I didn't mind but my 15 year old daughter was a bit lost lol. Other than that easy, worry free flight."
"I have traveled with US Airways / American for 30years.  American has been my airline of choice for all my flights. I have little issues with them and they are typically on time.  The captain and crew have been so courteous.  That said, my experience in the airports I travel through h be been the complete opposite.  I don't believe this is for all of them but I could easily say 75% of the gate agents are rude, inpatient, and simply do not want to give bothered. The worst one was recently when flying through Dallas Fort Worth. This gate agent at DFW on Wednesday afternoon August 11, 2021 a flight going to CLT was the worst individual I have ever encountered.  I was not the only one either. An American Airlibes employee was treated just as poorly as I was and HE WORKS FOR THE SAME COMPANY.  Another nice gentleman behind me asked about whether or not he cleared the wait list as he was the first one on the list.  This guy is an executive platinum member with American.  This gate agent said he we oukd have to wait like everyone else and she was working the list.  Mind you the other gate agent who was also there was courteous to everyone.  A gentleman came up to her ... Same question about clearing the wait list.  Guess what...he got a confirmed seat immediately.   What?  Come to find out there were 30 open seats.  So the #1 person on the list with a ton of miles with American was treated this way, I was treated the same, and her own colleague, do you think this person should be in this position?  I don't.  She should be happy she has a job.  Maybe she is working alot but I can tell you as a nurse myself working 6 days a week she has NO idea. American I only hope you evaluate this gate agent.  She should not represent your brand."
We really lucked out that Darling was our customer service representative because she was extremely helpful and very considerate. The four stars are pretty much only for her.
Garbage. First class felt like coach and coach felt like trash. Delays after delays. 15$ vouchers for a hotel when our Costa Rican flight got diverted toMiami. Definitely staying far away from AA. better service on JetBlue or United.
"Horrible! Do yourself a favor and use any other airline. Not only are they over priced but you will be treated like   an animal. Delays and cancellations and no one will tell you why. You will spend hours delayed at an airport only for the staff to give you major attitude before they cancel your flight. I've flown American before and never had an issue. Now they claim that post Covid, there are too many travelers and they can't handle it. If the airline cannot handle your business than give your business to someone else! Once your flight is canceled, you will have to fight for the refunds and vouchers that you are entitled to! Fucking trash airline."
"Great customer service!!! Would definitely recommend them."" Aug 21, 2021LouiseBelleMead (14 reviews)Belle Mead, NJI booked non-refundable tickets with American for travel to attend a Memorial service. Subsequently, the venue changed the date to outside my flight timeframe so I cancelled my flights. I called American and explained the situation. THEY GAVE ME A FULL REFUND!!!Bottom Line: I highly recommend American Airlines for excellent customer service."

This has got to be the worst airline ever!! First flight was cancelled right off the bat and then Sat with hundreds of other people at terminal A at Newark airport yesterday as we all waited as our flights got delayed and delayed and ultimately cancelled.  An entire Father's Day weekend getaway ruined.  Sucks!!!!! Will not fly them again.
"When you call customer service, they encourage you to check online for updates. No wonder humans are being replaced by robots. Pointless and not helpful at all. Especially when online updates weren't even updated.  Get it together American!"
"Worst airline I've ever flown.  Dirty planes and god awful Customer Service.  I used to fly 100,000 miles for business and told my corporate travel agent to avoid them at all costs."
"Now that we're essentially grounded, I have to say service on American Airlines has never been better. No flights and no passengers guarantee ample legroom and an automatic score on an upgrade. And gee whiz, no more surly malcontents behind the counter barking boarding instructions in German. And I just know they're going to use their bailout windfall to improve service, vanquish fees and mandate smiles all around. I just know it. Have a swell day."
I wish I could give this airlines zero stars. They are absolutely incompetent and rude. I had spoke to a representative and was told that I would get a full refund if I were to cancel a flight I was no longer able to go on. After this representative assured me I would get a full refund for my flight I went ahead and cancelled and then was told I was not eligible for a refund. Nikita the supervisor was nothing but rude and completely unhelpful. I asked her a question and she completely ignored me and ended the conversation. In the past flying with American I have had absolutely nothing but problems and inconveniences. I would pay for any airline over this one.
I would rather have someone run over my face with a lawnmower then ever use these services again
They just switched my flight from departing at 6am we are all loaded to departing at 7am I have work today and now Im going to be late  Im glad I can count on them
"I had the worst experience. When I traveled to Ecuador it was all fine. But when I come pack they charge 45$ for my carryon I don't remember hearing about that and no one told me and they charged my carryon because the airplane is ""small"" it wasn't suppose to be charged which is so annoying and I am so upset. And then we went back to Miami and they made me lose my flight until they wanted to reschedule my flight and that's my bad experience and I will never fly with them."
"July (first few days of the month) 2019 -Booked roundtrip flights from Bogota to Miami to Milan for May 2020.March 2020 -Free exchange - modified flights to October (as listed above).May 21, 2020 -Viewed flight information online - listed roundtrip to Miami only (NO communication from them that flights were modified).Called and did free exchange.  Roundtrip flights from Bogota to Miami to London to Milan.June (I called early June) -Canceled flights and received free credit tor future travel.  I knew if we waiting until early July, we could get tickets for May 2021.July 2 - Spoke to American Air and changed flights to May 2021. Booked roundtrip flights from Bogota to Miami to Milan. No cost to modify flights. Also gave us $400 travel vouchers for future flights - we received emails for the updated tickets and the vouchers.July 5 - Viewed flight information - listed us flying from Bogota to  Miami to JFK to Milan.  In JFK, gave us 24 minutes to make the connecting flight to Milan.  The return showed Milan to JFK to Miami.  In Miami, we would have to stay overnight and fly back the next evening (NO communication from them that flights were modified).  Called American Air (very early in the morning) and canceled tickets.  Getting full refund (for the tickets).Booked roundtrip flights on Lufthansa from Bogota to Frankfurt to Milan."
"Let's just say i had a flight tomorrow morning where it was going to be very convenient. Now this morning flight at 730 got cancelled because they didn't have enough flight crew, why would you notify us less than 12 freaking hours about this cancellation? If you knew you wouldn't have enough crew why would you wait less than 12 hours before instead of saying it earlier in the day? I'm ashamed, they're lucky I have too many miles to use or else I wouldn't fly them again"
"Ridiculous to pay $568 for a domestic ticket and then be asked to pay an additional $12 more to ""choose"" my seat - even if its back row middle.  Paying to choose from available seats just shows that AA still nickels & dimes their customers every chance they get.  It's not a transparent, honest way to do business.  American Airlines does not demonstrate integrity with customer pricing, which is probably the case in every area of their business, including customer safety."
"If I could give NO STATS, I would. Never on time.  Always rebooking and rescheduling because no one inspects the plane.  Last time first flight of the day and plane needed a battery. Today we flew halfway (1hr) to our destination (that was 2hrs away.). Crew detected ""toxic fumes"" and instead of flying the hour forward to the destination, we flew an hour back to where we came from. All flights for everyone on the plane rescheduled.  I was supposed to arrive in Gainesville FL at 2p but ended up getting in after 11pm and completely missing my job interview bc that was the soonest they could do... it wasn't good enough. American is the worst airline. Completely unreliable. I will not book another flight with American again."
"Real revue, from a real customer, based on the experience flying from Newark to Paris connecting in Chicago.Do not, under any circumstances fly American. No matter how little you pay for the ticket!"
"I think it is terrible that during this crisis you are only offering change options through the end of this year.  We do not know if travel will be safe in December as we do not know when this pandemic will be over. Your customer service was extremely rude unprofessional and short. This is by far one of the worst pandemic responses and cancellation policies I have encountered,and this after having to cancel/alter three trips. It is deplorable that you treat your customers like this especially during these unprecedented times.  I will not be using your airline in the future and will be sure to let everyone know how little AA thinks of their customers safety and hard earned money.  Disgraceful."
Here we are going to bail out the airlines and they Now are playing games.  Delaying flights 3 hours to combine planes due to low passengers.  Year no compensation to to us for sitting 3 hours in the airport.  More corruption.   I think that the government should take into consideration the services provided during the crises and reward the airlines that continue to keep on time planes and not play games with the very people who will be bailing them out.   American normally is pretty good except for the drunk pilot a few month back that was in a bar and 2 hours late.  Now the 3 hour wait to combine planes.   Sad.
"One particular lady we won't mention her name is a witch to say the least. Not only is my flight initially delayed it ends up being cancelled. The customer service I experience at this counter was beyond horrible. She made no concerned effort to diligently do what she was hired for. The level of attitude I experienced from her was unexplainable. Sorry dear but it isn't you that was stranded by an airline of choice and told to deal with it, there is nothing we will do for you. @americanairline you have failed! Immensely! #aa #americanajrline should review policy. Such a disappointing experience."
Decent service by staff. Some not as friendly as others. Airplanes have WiFi and you can watch free TV shows and movies on the AA app.
If i could give zero stars I would. Weekend of 08/10/18 was in Canada w friends who chose to fly American. I flew air canada. Both flights returing to nyc. American canceled due to weather. Air canada flew. Today (4 days later) flying from lga to las vegas w layover in Philadelphia. Flight to  Philadelphia canceled due to maintenance. American air rebooks me to but must leave from newark. I ask of they provide transportation since they are rebooking me at different airport. I was told that if i accept rebooking i am responsible for my own transportation. I frantically jumped in the first cab (cash only) in hopes of making my newly rebooked flight. Upon arrival to newark i spoke w a customer service rep for AA who told me they SHOULD have provided transportation bc is it was a mechanical issue n i should jump thru leaps and bounds of customer service refunds on their website. Nothing could be done to further accommodate me! And they tout goodwill compensation all over their website. Shame. Dont fly american.
Worst customer service. 6 hour delay at the last minute for a 6AM flight and they get angry when you ask any questions and give no clear answers. Use any other airline.
"This airline SUCKS! Not one person who works for AA in the DCAairport knows what's going or even cares! Rude employees, ineptness and lack of information was amazing! Would give NO STARS if I could! Should change your name; PROUD AMERICAN AIRLINES YOU ARE NOT!"
"So when you tell a customer that a wedding dress is considered ""company policy"" but the customer takes this from the ""company website"" your just lying.  The young man at Miami international airport just wanted to throw his non authority around at 11pm when I just want to go home.   Nice try and and A for effort but he along with the ""company policy"" was a joke   Next time read the manual.    And only in the alphabet of American Airlines does A and F go together.  When you can show me alphabet that they are together I will buy you a ticket!!"
"I would give them negative if I could.I like to think that I'm well travelled. I'm a Qantas frequent flyer & never have I received sichbad service in Australia. Ok except Jetstar, once.First of all the check in lady asked me twice if I was in the right line. Then asked me why I had to use a passport. Seriously? In NYC? I told her I don't have a US government issued id. Then I asked her my baggage allowance as the frequent flyer status I held & was told that she was ""too busy to check"" for me & to ring the airline.. Next I asked for a fragile sticker for my souvenirs & she said she ran out. I offered to find it for her then she said they don't use it anymore as they're not liable. Seriously?! I suppose airlines in the 3rd world countries r richer to be liable or r more attentive?!Then she told me to remove fragile items from my checked luggage. F.A.I.LI don't even understand y Qantas bothers to partner with such a retarded airline. I will rather fly budget if I'm getting the shits from One World alliance. Unbelievable."
"American Airlines has let me down once again...I fly out of NJ usually 3-5x a year. I have experienced many different airlines that are accommodating and make your flying experience comfortable. However, this time around with AA I haven't even made it to the airport yet and they're already a hassle. Hurricane Irma has made its destruction throughout the Caribbean and unfortunately that's where our destination was to. AA does not want to waive the change fee and after many conversations with rude customer service personnel all they could say was ""there's nothing more we can do."" Being told you have a year to fly out to the same destination after the island has been demolished was just like hearing them say ""tough luck."" This has happened previously in the past where flight changes had to be made with other airlines such as United Airlines and Delta due to severe weather damage and they were very understanding and accommodating unlike American Airlines. I would not recommend American Airlines to those who want to feel comfortable and secure with the ticket purchase they've made."
