"I overslept and missed my flight, which had my emotions all over the place first thing in the morning. The customer assistance agent named Eliam had such a calm and positive presence that it immediately took my anxiety away. Her co-worker was bubbly and had me laughing, which completely turned my day into joy. I applaud American Airline for hiring these two!!"
Yet again.  Late flights from American.  Said to be getting in early but waited on tge tarmac to get to the gate.  Ended as late arrival.
"12.7.2021 Travel:As with the Gate Agent, the Flight Crew from ATL to PHX was wonderful & pleasant. I barley fly AA as this trip was a gifted ticket.I graded the experience a B+. No issues with the cabin service, the cleanliness of the lavatory or Wi-Fi connection. I see the Wi-Fi usage fees are increasing across the three airlines I've used in 2021.Predicated on the Pandemic shifting more safely for air travel & if the fares stay comparable (especially 1st Class), I could see myself flying more with AA than my other preferred Airline."
"Although the aircraft is clean and there was no severe delay for our flight to & from Atlanta, the seats are too compacted. There's little to no leg room for passengers, therefore it's uncomfortable. The check in process is pretty seamless in the event that your checked in luggage weighs under 50 pounds.  Not my go-to airline whatsoever."
"Another flight in the books... Traveling by air is sooo less glamorous then it was!Cramped flights... rude people... security hassles... duffle on shuffle off. When you do it as much as I do you realize all it really is is one beg pain! At least on American I can pic my seat...  it's hard to give any airline a great rating anymore... they all have their issues. At this point it is almost like ranking the best of the bad.Ok... my flight left on time, I arrived on time, my luggage made it too, and I got there in good shape... ultimately that is what matters!"
"This airline is DOG WATER.Disorganized. Asinine policies. No sense of urgency. No accountability. Delayed my flight 5hrs then canceled it. Everyone on the flight had to re-book. We stood in line for over 3hrs to get a new flight, hotel voucher, and meal vouchers. Never actually spoke to the ONE human handling 300+ on-site re-bookings. Got the flight + vouchers over the phone while in line. Then they lost my checked bag.The next available flight was 2 days later, but they only gave out hotel vouchers for 1 night, so I had to check out of the hotel and go back to the airport to get another voucher - for some inexplicable reason they wouldn't do it over the phone again. Waited at the baggage claim office all day while they searched for my bag. One employee was quite kind and helpful, but I still had to insist that they continue looking for my bag instead of following their advice to just ""wait and see if it ends up at your final destination."" Yo, I've got my meds and my life in there, I'm not just leaving that up to ""whatever!""I would give American Airlines a -666 score if I could. The 1 star goes to the two employees who were polite and got my 2nd night hotel voucher and continued the search for my bag - and finally found it!"
Worst airplane service ever!! 1.5 hour delay than the captain says we need to get more fuel. Sitting in first class where not only do they not offer you a drink or anything while waiting this long but completely ignore everyone one in first class while standing around talking about make up and lunch etc. there is a new trainee on board and the seem to be very Interested in what she has going on with her life and one guy even laugh and said do you want to go out and answer questions? As a joke. Same guy was bragging that although he does the bare minimum he always gets 100'on his surveys. He is giving this advice to the new girl.Can't believe this is what first class is on AA. I'm sitting  holding a sleeping baby with no water in a hot plane while staff look after themselves. Flight 982 to Dallas from Atlanta  was supposed to leave at 12:40 but currently 2 pm and still waiting. You need to do better and hire better staff
"I like this airline. I don't like the smaller planes they use, such as American Eagle. The Airbus is much faster and more comfortable."
"Never. Again. The baggage check women in Atlanta, including ZUELIN, are cold, bitter and meaner than starving junkyard dogs. The men employees are normal but the women hate the customers (obviously women customers who look a certain way, get my drift) who pay a lot for tickets. And the heavy suitcases they order you to hoist on the scale, ignoring your request for someone to help. Oh and nitpicking about luggage weight so you have to go off and open your suitcases and repack.Manager Jesus was gracious and caring but Manager MICHELLE PENGALLY - what a hate filled piece of work she is. I requested to talk to her about the rude women and she stood right there side by side with one of them while I explained my concerns. Intimidating and just wrong. She babbled excuses but I told her the overall problem was rudeness.I'd just arrived to fly home from my mother's funeral and dealing with these icicle women disguised as airline employees made me just start crying. Never. Again."
"Upon arriving at the gate for a 33 minute in air flight,  I observed another flight that was canceled with a long line of people waiting at customer service.  Just then,  my flight was delayed due to the absence of the flight crew.  We then switched planes and gates to a larger plane to accommodate yet another canceled flight from the day before. We finally boarded with a flight crew, but after the doors were closed,  we were deplaned since the crew ran out of hours. This was not an issue with the airport or with the crew,  but rather with the scheduling of American airlines flights and not accounting for weather or maintenance or other imminent delays. With so many choices,  why anyone would choose American Airlines after seeing hundreds of people canceled without refunds, without food vouchers, and without hotels all trying to sleep in the airport that had no open businesses this time of day is beyond me.  American Airlines should be closed due to poor business practices."
"The airplane was the cleanest I have seen for US flight. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful, as were the gate staff.on entry to the plane, we were each handed a bag containing a bottle of water, a packet of cookies, and an alcohol wipe.I was very surprised to have free in-flight entertainment on a US flight, it was very good as well.I was very pleased overall."
"This company is the worst.  So unorganized and incompetent.   They make all their mistakes and problems the customers.  And then they have some creepy weirdo as pat down security.  Dude had too much pleasure and enjoyment groping adults and children.  If I searched an inmate like that I would be looking at a law suit.  Completely violated. Avoid this airline at all costs.  O and to top it all off they lost our golf clubs with over 6K of brand new custom fitted clubs and merchandise with a weeks worth of tournaments scheduled.  Their answer ""maybe you can rent something until one day they are located and if so you can wait till they are delivered"". These are the most stupid incompetent people on the planet.  Who don't a damn about you"
They are the worst airline I have ever flew in my life My daughter is in a wheel chair and I had a collapsed lung. Explain to the manager and showed her my paperwork from the hospital of it. She didn't care. She sat me all the way in the back of the plane.  If you need to fly. Fly anything but American Airlines. Be smart.
"American Airlines has one of the most in-human check-in processes known to man kind! Why then do I use them? Their Black Platinum card stellar point rewards system and airport lounges of course!  Those two are the best things about American Airlines. I have learned over time the best way to  deal with it and make the process a  little less painful. Plus once you get past the security gates, you are golden or platinum!Check in online, PLEASE!! Number one rule to not use those kiosks that sometimes work. Plus people panic when they see technology and not a human so they take so freaking long. There is usually an attendant but they are helping others who are kiosk challenged. If you check in you get your boarding pass electronically, take a screen shot in case Wi-Fi or your reception is spotty and you are good to go if you only have a carry on.Checking in luggage is a whole other story! Sometimes baggage drop off will print you up your luggage tag and other times you have to print it up at the kiosk. It depends on the airport really. I normally walk straight up, if there is no line, to the baggage drop off and pray that that they will print it for me. At ATL, I stood in line and I was sent back to the kiosks to print it up. There was no avoiding it here! The first one was not working when I tried to scan my boarding pass that was on my phone but found an attendant who scanned it for me on another kiosk. It's a crap shoot really!The AA attendants and people at the baggage drop off were good, a bit impersonal but I guess that goes with the impersonal touch of the kiosks. I understand that the kiosks are supposed to save time if used correctly but you always have the panickers who are kiosk challenged.For AA at ATL, check in on-line and if you have check-in luggage go to the kiosk to print up your baggage tag. It is what it is."
"It's not difficult to see why AA is rated 10th by Forbes as far as airlines in the US.  All you have to do is go to the bag drop and be treated like garbage by the lady taking your luggage.  If you aren't strong enough and you don't like hefting 50lb bags around for a job, find another job."
"Written along with Yelper Elizabeth M:From the start of our trip going to Costa Rica by way of Miami, the conditions aboard the plane should be considered unethical. As females of average weight and height (and even smaller actually!), we felt as if we were shoved into a small box. Not to mention the seats provided did not have under-the-chair storage for our personal items (which were within standard acceptable size limits) to appropriately fit, further decreasing the already incredibly limited leg room provided. Neither of us were offered room in an over head bin to accommodate this.Upon return home to the US not only did travel standards provided prove to be equally unbearable, but American Airlines staff was extremely rude and unempathetic. Our flight from Costa Rica to Miami was delayed almost an hour due to ""maintenance"". Due to this delay, our plane arrived near Miami at the time where they stated they could not land because of the weather (before Dorian actually hit FL). Our plane circled in the sky for over 30 mins before deciding to land in Ft Myers to refuel. At this point, it became clear we may not make our connecting flight. We were not provided with enough information to possibly even call ahead to attempt to secure seats on other flights to our final destination in New York. The plane sat in Fort Myers for over 2 hours. The temperature was poorly controlled and passengers where not offered additional snacks or drinks. Not even a simple cup of water. When we finally took off and then landed back in Miami, we were not even directed on where to go or how to get new connecting flights. After running through the airport we finally came to rebooking, where we where met with complete lack of empathy or concern for AAs customers. We were told that it was not their problem the weather was bad, that there would be no more flights to NY that night, and the only thing they could give us was a stop over flight the next day to Dallas and then to NY (a completely illogical option considering we would be flying further away from our destination). Additionally, we were told we would not be given ANY HOTEL OR MEALS for the night. We were expected to sleep on airport floors which is completely unacceptable.The fact that this is AA's 1st course of action is completely deplorable. We were treated as if we are cattle and seen as nothing more than dollar signs. Yes, weather is uncontrollable but is this how you treat customers? What's more disgusting is that we were begging your employee to show some sympathy as at this point in our trip, we were already traveling for over 12 hours and were not even given water. After mentioning that this was unethical, suddenly he was able to provide us with hotel accommodations, meal vouchers and a flight back to NY via ATL. Suddenly after mentioning that we weren't just going to sleep in the airport and that we wouldn't leave without them at least giving us a drop of water, something clicked in him. Something done so easily but was met with complete resistance unnecessarily.You would think the insults to us via AA would have stopped there but NO. When boarding in Miami the next day, 1 of us was told to check her carry on bag for being to large. Mind you - this is the same bag,  packed the same way, that fit TSA/AA's size regulations for carryons for our three previous flights this trip. The carryon was suddenly too big. Instead of giving us an opportunity to reorganize the bag to please your employee who was clearly on a power trip, said employee began to belittle us and insult us as well as clap in her face as if he was on the street. She began to become emotional at the complete disrespect and disregard of these people at this point we have been traveling for over 24 hours. Exhausted and trembling in tears, she handed over her bag. She was now fearful that it may be tampered with because it did not have a lock, or that items inside would be broken because the bag was not not meant to be checked (as we all know luggage IS NOT handled with care when being loaded and unloaded).When we finally landed in ATL we discovered right outside our gate was another AA flight heading to NY leaving within the hour that had people on standby. This means instead of a 3hr layover we experienced in ATL we could have been placed on this plane and made it home 5 hours sooner. But when rebooking the night before this was not considered.The excessive take offs and landings, as well as the increase and decrease of pressure caused swelling in ankles and hands, an occurrence that DOES NOT HAPPEN to healthy young women. Since neither of us has experienced this before, it can only be attributed to the unnecessary pressure changes and borderline inhumane seating conditions endured while flying with AA.36 hours of traveling AND an incredibly rude airline? It was a nightmare, and you better believe we will both be filing formal complaints against their practices."
"Baggage Claim was ridiculously slow, over 45 minute wait.The positive thing about this airport is the departure process runs much better than arrival.I know it's not necessarily AA's fault but, I'm just saying.We'll see if the flight leaves on time. Flight left on time and arrived a few minutes early but had to wait a ridiculous amount of time for our bags??Wish someone could explain WHY."
"Flight 2256 from Atlanta to Miami and 20% of people aren't wearing masks properly by having them under their noses, and 5 or 6 have them on their chins. The guy in the aisle seat next to us is hacking up a lung. Flight attendants say nothing to them but at least made a PA announcement that did nothing and changed nothing. Hope we don't get COVID."
"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! With American Airlines. The girlfriend and I were booked on flight 1826 from ATL to PHX. The staff held all passengers on the plane for more than 2 HOURS for test maintenance until finally downing the plane. At this point, they apologized AND proceeded to hand us a paper telling the passengers to (CALL THE NUMBER) to rebook flights and transfers!!!  They didn't offer any vouchers AND/OR reimbursement for any inconvenience to ANY of the passengers. Worst experience and will never fly American AGAIN!!!"
"I was flying out of Atlanta, GA this past Friday on a flight to Miami, connecting to Houston and the trip was cancelled hours before departure. I first called the customer service line, where I was told by an agent, "" I shouldn't have booked my ticket the way I did"" & there was nothing she could do. I then went to the AA ticket counter and the representatives shut down the line because it was too many people to deal with and they sent us to main gate for further assistance AFTER WAITING IN LINE FOR AN HOUR. I was placed on a standby flight for 6:50am the following day (in which that flight was full) & i could not board. The ticket agent then put me on standby for the next departing flight leaving at 9:14am, but told me because my name was so deep in the list, she couldn't be of much assistance. She let EVERY PASSENGER BOARD STANDBY EXCEPT ME. I then had to catch a flight to DC from Atlanta, just to get to Miami. 24 hours spent in an airport with the utmost rude and unprofessional people I've ever encountered..oh it gets better... my flight (AA1545) from Miami to Atlanta was not only delayed again , but AA then told me that my carry-on bag was now ""too big"" and forced me to pay the check-in bag fee, only for me to arrive to my gate & AA was checking in bags COMPLIMENTARY! i AM BEYOND PISSED. THIS ENTIRE EXPERIENCE WAS AN INCONVENIENCE FROM START TO FINISH AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS DISGUSTING!!!i WILL NEVER FLY THIS AIRLINE AGAIN, NOR RECOMMEND ANYONE WITH COMMON SENSE TO DO SO EITHER."
This airline is the absolute worst service and personnel in all the airlines I have flown  from the woman who help with the kiosk to the gate people and flight crew. Absolutely zero in customer service I would rather fly in a crop duster. Y'all suck American Airlines never again. Jack
Never seem to be disappointed by American Airlines. On our way to Kauai for our anniversary they changed the time of our second flight. Instead of an hour and 15 minutes our layover was only 45 minutes. And then they got to LAX late so we had to run to our flight. Well we made it but of course our bags did not. 2 days in our warm weather clothes. No clothes for the anniversary date. Dive gear missing as well so no sport activity either. Should have flown Delta.
Worst service ever! Our flight from Atlanta to Miami was cancelled and the lady with such a bad attitude told us to go the guest service which was out of the boarding area. There they told us there was another flight departing to Miami which we would haven taken if she hadn't told us to go out since now we had to go thru security again. They did not cover us with a night stay at the hotel so in other words they left us stranded in Atlanta!! Very unreliable service
"Attention all Folks that were scheduled to take off on Friday 4/1/2016 with American Airlines Flight 4465 ATL to LGA.. American Airline lied to us and told us it was a weather issue in order to avoid paying for our lodging fees. I pulled a historical Flight Status report and found that American was the only airline to cancel on 4/1/2016. The information can be found at Flightstats.com The truth was that (16) flights were able to land in LGA and (10) in JFK and (8) in HPN Westchester NY. Interesting Facts that American was the only airline to cancel and lied to us all.  I also found out that we have the right to file a complaint with the US Department of Transportation Please stand up for your rights and file a complaint today. I for one want my hotel stay, cab service and Fees refunded. The link to file your complaint is airconsumer.dot.gov/esco…"
Flying the ghetto sky's...omg what happen to American Airlines. I guess I've been using Delta and jet blue to long. I was not expecting a shitty old  plane and shitty service from your staff.
"Another airline I find myself displeased. My parents and I are suppose to go on a cruise. Flight was to leave 5:50am. Got to the airport at 4:46am. Some reason we got pushed to the next flight with no explanation. Now we have missed two flights. Person at the counter lied and said we were onto the next flight. They then told us that the person at the counter forget to check us in. So my question is ""how are you going to make it up???!"". We have a cruise leaving at 3pm.Now they are telling that we have to pay for a new ticket....this is really disappointing for my parents 40th anniversary. Very unprofessional ...."
"American Airlines & Republic Airways should be boycotted for not protecting the safety of a female passenger who alerted the flight crew she was being physically abused by a male passenger.  This is the most disgusting behavior by an airline I have ever heard of.Take your business elsewhere, there's ample competition.cnn.com/2020/02/18/us/pl…American Airlines said it was aware of the January 31 ""customer dispute"" aboard American Eagle flight 4392, operated by Republic Airways."
9/10 times the airline is late with no explanation. Flight tonight was 4 hours late. Will not be flying this airline ever again. My 10 pm arrival times always turn into 2 am arrival times. Unreliable beyond belief.
"American Airlines sucks!!! I was supposed to fly out to London with a school group tonight but somehow there was an issue with the pilots running out of work time, which delayed the flight 4 hours making it impossible to catch the connecting flight in Philadelphia. Now I have to go back to the airport in the morning and I won't get to London for another day. This means I will miss a day of my trip due to an error on behalf of this airline. What a cheap ripoff! Would not recommend American Airlines."
Horrible customer experience will never fly again!!!! Never on time. Always miss my events and the tickets are to high to never be on time to your destination!!!! Spirit Airlines is better and I can't believe I gave soul plane a compliment! FUCK AMERICAN AIRLINE.
"Very disappointed in American Airlines. Not loyal to their loyal customers, in short, because of their airmail policies.  I was a member with them for decades, carry a credit card with their name, but I now I feel abused.  Like others, I had 'forever miles' amounting to 100s of 1000s, which were lost. They changed their policy to 'miles expiring in 18 months' without notifying me or others with longstanding memberships. Now it actually costs $75 to get a 'air mile history' statement in the mail! And that's for only 18 months' time going back. Even if you have an email record of having American Airlines miles they simply won't honor those records. Even their AA specialists won't give you any history further back than 18 months. Better to go with an airline that honors its promises to its customers.I'm re-evaluating my longstanding loyalty to this airline now."
"I've worked customer service for 15 years. I have never been so angry about the poorest customer service in my life. American Airlines updated my brother's flight almost 2 hours early. I booked the flight 2 months ago in August. My notification was only a few hours before. Then, they held him up for about 35 min. between check-in & security. One baggage claim person wasn't helpful, so I demanded a supervisor checking my brother's 1 bag in. The supervisor looked at me and above or pass me to ignore me thinking I didn't catch that rudeness. She tries to help, but at this point, we've missed boarding. I spoke to 2 more supervisors at the airport. They told me to contact priceline with my booking about the flight change. Priceline told me to contact American Airlines. Then, the last supervisor,over the phone, Gail Williams, tells me to talk to a supervisor at the airport. She clearly didn't hear me, ""I did that already!"" Saying the line is recorded. I know it's recorded. I did not curse at her. I threatened to review American Airlines on social media, and all the sites I can. I've already done 5, and I'm not going to stop. She wasn't sympathetic, she wasn't helpful and she didn't remedy the issue in any way. My brother is the sweetest guy you'll ever meet. 12 hours on standby without guarantee of a flight? Really?! He was polite to everyone he spoke to at the airlines & airport. This is the 2nd time I've had a poor experience with this airline. Everybody got me playing the telephone game. The supervisors are useless. My brother has been waiting for over 12 hours on standby. Some employees want to tell him what gate he should be at, others don't. What kind of nonsense is that? This is the worst airline I've ever dealt with. Never again!!! I will never recommend this airline to anyone."
"As a frequent flyer, I would like to caution as many travels as possible against flying American Airlines.  I've never in my my years of travel experienced the lack of customer service from ANY airline that I've experienced from American.  I recently purchased a one way ticket through American Airlines from Atlanta to Portland.  Prior to arriving at the airport I received several text messages indicating that the we would not likely make the connection to Portland based on delay on the flight leaving Atlanta.  This included a link giving you the option to rebook.  Based on this message, I made arrangements to be picked up at the connection which was in LA.  When it was my turn to board the flight (after scanning my ticket) I was told that I would need to check my bag.  I asked the woman speaking to me if she would mind checking to see if there was any space (to which is responded very rudely; No) . I then explained the situation and asked if my bag could be checked to LA.  The response was again, no.  She eventually tagged by bag and said ok, and began to roll it in the direction of the ramp.  Immediately after, another lady from the ticketing area slammed the door.  (In front of me and the lady rolling my bag) and said that I could not get on the plane.  I asked why, and she indicated that I did not want to go without my bag.  I said multiple times that I wanted to get on my flight.  (No one would directly speak to me) They then proceeded to open the door for individuals behind me one at a time until they reached the standby passengers.  (They were allowed to board as well) I was then rebooked and told to return the next morning.  I called customer service multiple times and was told there was NOTHING they could do.  And that they did me a ""favor"" by rebooking me.  When I arrived at the airport the next morning, I was number 2 on the standby list HOWEVER, a family of 6 was allowed to board ahead of me.  Needless to say I did not make it onto that flight and was placed on the standby list for 4pm.  (Which was also a full flight) . I ended up having to purchase a $650 one way and have not been able to make any progress with American Airlines.  What is the purpose of having a customer service division if you will not in fact service the customer??  Hope this helps you with your future travels."
"Several people traveling in my group had issues with their bags, including me. I arrived 33 hours ago and I still don't have my bag. It's been at the airport since 7:30 yesterday evening, but apparently just went out for delivery about 30 minutes ago. Even worse, I've been told delivery can take up to 6 hours. I could've picked up my bag myself yesterday and it would've only taken about an hour total. Ridiculous. Our flight home was also delayed several times for a total delay of 3 hours due to ""weather"". It wasn't even drizzling outside, and several other airlines had departures during this ""weather"" delay. I wouldn't take this airline again even if they paid me."
"Can I change my answer to a half star? Flew to Atlanta from Philly Friday night, and beginning the moment we cleared TSA, the serial flight delays began. First 15 mins, then an hour, then another hour, and ultimately we took off over 4 hrs late, after one unnecessary return to the gate. Returning home, same thing. No notice of weather delays until we got to the gate, then the ETA got pushed back 30 to 60 minutes several times. Plus a gate change, which ultimately left us with a plane that couldn't muster cabin pressure (no one thought to check this during the orevious three hours, I guess). American then announced that EITHER our flight was cancelled or it would leave in another 7.5 hours, at 5:00 am. They get half a star for permitting us to scedule a different flight. Oh, yippee."
