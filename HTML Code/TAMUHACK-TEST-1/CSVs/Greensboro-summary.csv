-Customer service is terrible, with many employees being rude and inconsiderate
-There was no reimbursement for any of the extra expense or inconvenience caused by American Airlines
-American Airlines doesn't seem to be too concerned with customer service any longer
-Despite some negative reviews, American Airlines remains a popular choice for many flyers due to its generally on-time flights and friendly staff
-The majority of reviewers noted significant delays and cancellations with American Airlines, with many citing poor customer service and a lack of transparency from the company
-The staff was pleasant, however, letting customers know they need to print boarding pass for pre check would have saved me the agro pat down from the GDP TSA cronnies
-The boarding experience, flight and exiting the plane period were unenjoyable. Melanie, our flight attendant, was unaccommodating and rude
