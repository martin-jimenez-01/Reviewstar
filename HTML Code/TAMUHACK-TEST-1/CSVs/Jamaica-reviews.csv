"The American Airlines terminal at John F. Kennedy Airport is one of the newly renovated terminals JFK. The thing to know is, you'll need to give yourself plenty of time when traveling from New York because it's a very large terminal and there's escalators you'll go down then you'll have to walk a corridor, then there's more escalators you'll go up and you have to walk another stretch to get to the gate. Additionally, you'll want to give yourself plenty of extra time, because with people starting to travel again there seems to be full flights, overbooked flights and long lines at the TSA check points, and plenty of delays. The upside is once you're in New York there's plenty to do including seeing some of the newest plays on Broadway which BTW Broadway is up and running."
"Literally the worst airline on the planet*Listen AA, I don't know who hurt you, or who hurt your One World partners, but you all need to work on whatever issues you have with a therapist. To compare you with Spirit or Ryan Air would be an affront to their good names.Thoughts regarding check in:This is far and away the biggest ""seriously, what is wrong with you?"" issue I've ever seen with any airline. Rude attendants providing no guidance as to what line one should get in, simply shouting at folks - go to the self-check in. Then, atrociously long lines at those aforementioned self-check-in counters that don't work well (""there's an issue, wait for help""), then one. ONE attendant working the field of 50 or so machines where nearly everyone has an issue? Need a visual, then picture this:Literally hundreds of people struggling to check into their flights, muttering ""OMFG American sucks"" nearly in harmony at 6am on a Saturday morning...it was like a really sad frustrated chorus. The singing got louder when most of us realized that it was 30$ per bag, even those of us who hold AA credit cards (mine was promptly canceled when I found out that the ""free bag"" was only on domestic routes - RIP CITI).You must, MUST learn from your competition rather than just buying them up and ruining them. Delta, for example, is MUCH more pleasant when checking in, status or not, and United feels like a dream compared to your crap customer service. Why can't you emulate them? No, instead you ""partner"" with Alaska(RIP), and Jet Blu(RIP) to the horror of those who found themselves in T8 instead of T5, confused, frustrated and abandoned**.Thoughts on Terminal 8:Once through the torment of check in, you make your way through what appears to be a nice enough terminal, until you get to the world's longest escalator. NBD right? Wrong. This particular mountain cuts under the tarmac so planes can get in, and while the downslope escalator was working, the upslope was not. your choices then become:A) Wait a year or so for the elevatorB) Forced cardio - I imagine that the maniacs who run AA do this to reduce weight on board for fuel savings - they cut TVs for the same reason so it checks out.Anyway, when we finally got to our gate, we found a lack of places to hang out preflight not that we had much time after the long check in process. We opted for the little diner which was nice enough, rather than wait on the 30 min line for dunkin. All in all...T8 is exceedingly meh.On board ""experience"":It gets, if you can believe it, worse. I, in my ignorance, booked nicer ""extra room"" seats, as the rest of the flight had been booked on miles***, so I figured why not spend a little to be comfortable. The seat was fine enough, pretty much what you'd expect from a normal seat on Jet Blue (where they are...you know...free.....for now). There was however, no TV at any seat on the plane. They do this, as it's cheaper when buying the plane, and it saves on fuel - if anyone tells you otherwise, they are lying. They compensate by streaming to your device, which would be completely OK with me, however they app sucks (SHOCKER). No inflight map? Come on guys, every other legacy carrier has figure this out, I want to know where I am (as do most people). No free inflight texting WIFI? Again, literally EVERY other carrier does this now, why can't I text for free? Hell, your new partner Jet Blue gives folks free wifi all the way to London? Can't wait to watch you and BA slowly drain the cool factor away from them and Alaska in the years to come, should do wonders for your market share.Food:Nope. Hope you like a single cookie or pretzels, but not both! Also, premium economy or not, there is no beer or wine on these flights. ""Oh but COVID"", so you can serve soda but not beer? Get out of here with that, you cheap miserable bastards. EVERY other carrier has figured it out why can't you?The sales pitch:These guys give the most CRINGY boomery sales pitch for their credit card as the plane lands. PUKE.Conclusion:To paraphrase myself from when I had the pleasure of reviewing your partner BA, I would rather swim to Mexico with shark bate covering my body than step on one of your planes ever again. If I find myself in Terminal 8 at JFK for any reason, it won't be of my own accord and someone should contact the police immediately to report my kidnapping._______________*OK I have no evidence to back this up, but they are certainly the worst of the big 3 American carriers without a doubt**At the time of this writing Jet Blue is a new One World partner (puke), and I overheard more than one person in T8 bemoaning the fact that they were on an American flight instead of a Jet Blue flight. I can't say I blame them, and also, RIP Jet Blue.***praise be, I only have 800 miles left, all of which I will be happy to watch melt away in 18 months - AA miles expire unless you have account activity with a credit card or flight. Keep on winning with these guys!"
"We all have horror stories from AA. My most recent experience: I booked a flight on AA for this August to Hawaii (the big island). I bought us premium economy seats for me, my wife, and granddaughter. We had a direct non-stop flight. About 2 weeks later I check my account on the AA website and we had been downgraded to economy with 2 stops. They were still charging me the premium economy price. So I called and had the flight changed but they claimed they lost their gate in Kona so there would be one stop in Honolulu. I thought we were done. Some time later, I just happened to check my account again and this time they moved me to an entirely different flight, 2 stops, economy while keeping the same price. The wife and granddaughter were kept on their original flight. So again I called and changed back to where I should have been. No explanation why this was happening. It's still several months out from departure so I have to check regularly to make sure they don't pull any more stunts. Just unbelievable really. The nerve to downgrade me and then try to charge the higher price is infuriating, all with no notification whatsoever."
"I stopped flying AA for a while but recently decided to fly again with them as they have its main hub in Texas where we spent our holidays. We booked as well our flight  to Spain a week after for spring  travel  and found out that a major airline  bound to Spain ( Iberia) is partnered with AA. We planned to book a flight to Destin Florida and only AA is the popular airline flying there. So, I says to myself, have to take advantage of their frequent flyer program. We have a Boeing 747 plane going to Texas. I don't have much expectations as we flew domestically. Disappointed though that the movie played during the trip was old one. They offer better entertainment options but should have downloaded their app at your mobile or the site at your laptop prior flying. The complimentary snacks offer were either pretzel or cookies. They could have added some chips. When we booked and checked in  online, we were notified not guaranteed that we will be seated together, but for extra charge we could definitely get it, really ?!?!  We departed  late but made to our destination way earlier. I do not know if I'll be impressed or they are giving false arrival time to cover for something. Flight was smooth and that's the best service  they have provided."
When ever I fly American airlines I have hade no problems with them .the flight attendants and the  staff have been good to me and my family. We have being flying with them for a few years now.note if you fly regular economy you can use the over head for your carry on luggage. But if you are flying basic economy you will have to put your carry on bag under your seat
"I don't fly out of JFK very often but that may change based on today's experience. The trip in was very easy- an unusual occurrence but a welcome one. Once at the terminal everything went so smoothly. Our check in and bag drop was handled very efficiently. My husband required wheelchair assistance. The young woman who took care of him was delightful. She has a pleasant demeanor and was extremely courteous to my husband and the rest of the party. At the gate, we once again were treated to pleasant faces and courteous desk agents. The boarding process was painless and I'm looking forward to a smooth flight. Great experience!!"
"AA has a direct flight for me back to my hometown from NYC so I've flown with them often over the past 4 years. What I will say is that AA is inconsistent. As I fly/flew with AA often, I signed up for their miles program to start earning rewards. This is kind of a sham. You should really be able to use your miles towards a purchase and just pay the balance. I fly with AA all the time and still haven't been able to redeem my miles towards a single flight!Also, customer service has been great and also has completely sucked at times. I just never know what to expect with this company. I did recently have a bad flight experience to which they offered me a flight voucher, this I did really appreciate and made me feel like my voice was being heard. On the other hand, about a year ago, I had a huge issue with a desk representative yell at me at the airport for missing my flight (long story) and when I called AA customer service about it, they dismissed me and vouched for their employee's actions. This really upset me. I will still continue to fly AA, I just wish they worked to make their miles program more accessible and fixed their consistency issues. 3/5"
I don't like flying with American usually. They are pretty consistent being inconsistent. When their customer service is bad its bad. Sometimes their pilots talk to you sometimes they don't. I'd rather fly with anyone else
"Not my favorite airline to fly on but they do get the job done. I don't know if it's coincidence but if there is an issue with airline that I'm flying then American is usually the culprit. As far as the big airlines go, their customer service is not on par with the others. They flight attendants in general are a bit standoffish.They are good with their routes though as they fly pretty much any where, especially major stops and cities. I believe their main hub is in Dallas. They operate out of Terminal 8 at JFK."
"I came here at 4:30 am. It's a clean with brightly lighted lounge and yet still give a relaxing atmosphere . I'm impressed with breakfast selections from the basic scramble eggs, egg Benedict wrapped in bacon, nice selection of cheese and dried fruits for chattaturie, croissants and danish to kombucha smoothie with banana and ginger.I'm pleased worth the ambiance and the variety of food selections in this lounge."
"0 stars would be more appropriate. We have never had a worse experience than JFK to Madrid on 7/18/19. First, we boarded late, then sat on the runway for 2 hours while the pilot continually updated us ever 15 mins. Updates are great right? Not when he continually tells us it will only be 15 more mins, 8 times. Well we magically took off. Great, we are in the air right?Well we start heading to Madrid. In flight service was decent. The crew was nice on the plane.We are at least 2 hours into the flight, then the pilot opens his trap again. Apparently someone didn't do a systems check and the air conditioning gauge wasn't working. It is a neccessary system which has to be operable when flying over water.So we turn around and head back to JFK at 1030pm, but he assures us that American is bringing in another plane and we will depart JFK at 3am. No big deal, we lose a couple hours right?So we get back to JFK and are further assured about the 3am plane. Well after being back for an hour, they cancel the whole thing. Then they tell us the crew needs to rest and we can leave in 10 hours. Well it was all a lie and we all had to stand in line till 6am trying to find new flights. The counter crew was nasty, rude, and full of thugs. Their attitudes were very confrontational and they did nothing to help. We found our own flights on Google and they only allowed American flights.Positive, we were transported to a hotel which they paid for. Iberia Airlines bailed us out and we got to Madrid a few days later. American referred us to their 800# for all the $ we lost in hotels and transfer flights. All in all, American is full of liars and the most unprofessional staff members I have ever seen. They had multiple families, with small children, in tears and refused to help them. They just yelled at them and said ""not my problem""."
"Our journey onto three countries in South America oddly started off at JFK due to a American Airlines' oddball flight pattern.  After disembarking, we headed to what is now the ""regular"" Admirals Club.  Due to us having first class seats on our next leg and my spouse's level in the mileage program, we were offered the opportunity to utilize their brand spanking new Flagship Lounge.  Yes! FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE:It started with a courteous check-in.  If you think the lounge at DFW is nice, this one blows it out of the water!  A spacious, airy room welcomes you with views of the runway.  To the right is the Flagship First Dining Room (had our previous leg been in first, we could've dined there).  A buffet of cold and hot foods is bordered with beverage stations including beer, wine, soda and coffee.  Snacks like pistachio nuts were on a separate counter near the windows.  On yet another counter sat bottles of unlimited bubbly on ice.  Seating of all styles can be had including personal capsule-looking booths, lounge chairs, high and low tops.  A luggage storage room was available as was a small phone room, a phone-less phone booth if you will.  Numerous flight boards were abound and announcements were made due to our delayed flight. The food I had - Thai noodles, minestrone soup, potato salad, chicken fricassee, cauliflower & potato stir we're all good but seasoned very mildly in the sodium department.TIP:The lounge is open till 1am but will stay open until the last flight departs due to any delays. OVERALL:Very nice reward for AA's frequent fliers."
"This review is strictly for one employee, Abraham, who was working the first class/priority check in for AA at JFK on 9/6/14. She is the one of the few employees you come across, not just in the airline industry but in general, who actually cares about her job and people in general.  She was so pleasant, patient, friendly, and helpful while working with us to get upgraded.  Rarely do you encounter an employee of this caliber."
"It's a bit funny that the review shows this is an expensive place, considering that everything in is is free. :)So terminal 8 at JFK had a couple of admiral lounges. This one is by gate 12. It is supposed to be the better of the two in this terminal. So the ambience, seating, decoration... all are very nice and modern overall. They have a quiet room, TV areas, runway watching seating, eating area..etc. First class is available, but only for 3 class international flights. The down side (and that is a big down side), the food selection is small (maybe average). However the quality is low in my opinion. Food is either with little taste or over cooked."
"Food is prepped well and tasty with a variety of hi lo carb paleo and vegetarian options. It's under construction but you wouldn't know it.Still you have those random passengers who speak on their cell phones as if they were in their own private Idaho oblivious that all is quiet and content without them.They have all the amenities and services and replenished and tidy throughout. Full bar, meals, hot and beverages, snacks, showers, quiet areas, showers, rest area, etc, all you need for feeling refreshed. Info on large screens, tvs and papers to keep you abreast. It's a great lounge.I enjoyed my stay here for the two hours and will of course be back."
Yes - it can get worse...Complaint - please escalateI was upgraded to seat !A - than youBUTNO THANKSYour flight was 3 hours delayed - unacceptable!The entertainment system did not work despite 5 resets - UNACCEPTABLEI am abstaining from meat during lent - your only vegetarian option in first class was not available!!!  UNACCEPTABLEthis is a disgusting and most frustrating night.  I have been a loyal member for many years.I would like this to be escalated to your CEO - NOTHING LESS.  I am appalled by this airline's treatment of its top customers.  I am disgusted by your level of disservice. I cannot tell you hoe frustrating this experience has been and I cannot wait to post about it.DISGUSTEDLYMarios Damianides
Disgustingly dirty dinnerware on the flight.  Changed twice.  Could not eat it was so gross.
"Regina at the counter was an absolute angel. Nobody wanted to help us with the check in process and she helped us out. Thanks, Regina."
"Well well well....AA finally did something about their awful lounges in JFK. This lounge is the first to offer flagship dining, an extension of their flagship lounge. This dining experience was absolutely incredible, slightly exceeding Qantas dining at LAX. The food is delicious, cocktails are sourced with local gin and spirits, and the service is impeccable. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I am finally impressed with an AA lounge.If AA keeps this up, there will finally be a more compelling reason to fly AA over other legacy US carriers."
AA replaced Lanson Champagne with Prosecco over the weekend!Going for Great? Don't think so.
"I recently took my first flight on AA. What a great experience. After being screwed on UA three times this year, I was ready for a switch.I was flying Business class from JFK to Barbados. I had a huge surfboard bag with 6 surfboards. The gate attendant (both in JFK and Bridgetown) did not charge for the boards! That alone made the business class ticket worth it.Besides that, the new international business seats were very nice with video on demand for every seat. The flight attendants were also great.I will be flying AA again."
"A couple of friends and I started our Iberian adventure at the American Airlines Flagship Lounge at JFK, a nice little perk that came along with cashing in a bucket-full of points for business-class travel across the Atlantic. While most airline lounges in the US are showing their age and offer little more than complimentary coffee, a few nibblies, and a bit more comfortable seating than you'd have in the gate areas, the Flagship Lounge is markedly better than any other airline lounge I've been to within the US. It's obvious that AA has definitely made an effort to improve the premium-class travel experience by making a very good impression before even setting foot on the plane, something that foreign carriers have been doing for many years but is relatively new state-side.The lounge itself is huge - and it's a good thing that it is, since it was quite busy when we arrived, right before the late afternoon/early evening bank of flights across the Atlantic were due to depart. The design is contemporary and seating is plentiful and comfortable, with a combination of couches, lounge chairs, private booths, and high-tops. The high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows running the length of the lounge make for a very open and comfortable space, there's a quiet room for those who prefer a bit of solitude, and private showers for those who are between flights and need to freshen-up a bit.Everything in the Flagship Lounge is complimentary, including an extensive buffet with salads, cheeses, and a selection of hot and cold dishes, along with fruit and desserts that, on this night, included the iconic New York black-and-white cookies. There's two self-service bars, one for your liquors, the other for your wines and champagne - and, for those who need a different kind of pick-me-up, two cappucino/espresso machines for a little caffeine jolt. Beers are in the fridges, and there's one of those Coke-branded multi-soda machines as well.As others have noted, this is definitely a five-star experience when compared to other US airline lounges, but lags a bit behind those I've had the opportunity to visit in Europe. That aside, the staff here is quite attentive and friendly, making for a nice way to start a long voyage overseas."
"Received the absolute worst service today for my flight from NY to Paris. I went to the counter to ask ""maddie"" if there were options for switching seats. She said only business which runs over 3k. From what I remembered online was much cheaper so I had said really?! Is that US dollars? And her response was ""I think we are In america""Side note this is my first time traveling this far so I had no idea and just wanted to verify. She was very condescending.  I then asked for her name and she said she didnt have to provide that. I then said okay well can is peak to a supervisor because you are being very rude and I'm only asking for your first name. She went and got her supervisor,  I stated to tell her the situation and she immediately cut me off and said I cant bring my carry on, and I have to check it in. Mind you I was already approved to bring my carry on, on. So she was definitely only making me do that because I was complaining.  I was appalled. I said no I just flew with it as a carry on there shouldn't be a problem,  she said no it is a problem and you need to check it in. So I checked in my bag. So not only did the supervisor ignore my concern but she made ms check my bag in as a punishment.  I will NEVER fly with American agaun, and I will be cancelling my new american airlines CC. This is unacceptable! Supervisor was Joanne Austin Agent with the attitude was marpesh ""maddie""I will be sending in a letting with my complaint as . No one should be treated this way"
"There's an American Airlines Flagship Lounge at LAX but it's not nearly as impressive as this one. There's access to this lounge when you fly first class. Maybe business class too. I'm not sure.The buffet was beautiful. The Lentil soup had fresh lentils. Would you believe that? Not the soggy overcooked lentils. There was a wine and champagne station. There was even a Bloody Mary station with top shelf alcohol. There's plenty of beer, water, sodas, and alcohol. All complimentary. Of course, there was an espresso maker, which I used to make a cup of Americano.There's plenty of room here. There's even a quiet room. The one at LAX had showers. This probably had one too.Overall, this is an outstanding lounge! You're not milling about in a crowded airport with throngs of people."
"The flight itself was good. The reason I'm not recommemding them is. On Feb 4th while we we're waiting at the gate to board the plane.  The American Airline employee was on the microphone joking about we will begin boarding just as soon as her friemd with Corona Virus gets here. I emailed AA while I was still at the gate,  and here we are,  over a month later.  I have not heard back from them. Somebody,  please remind AA,  people are dying from this virus. NOT A JOKE"
"Better food... Much improved. Chicken and salmon that arent dry or in some nasty sauces. Cuscus and veggies.Looks like they are improving the catering significantly here.Only first class or oneworld emerald in biz class.Still looks a bit outdated, but most US lounges look like that."
Has a good flight experience with American. Staff was friendly and attentive. Airplane and gates were clean.
Always nice to escape the main waiting area of the airport on a long layover. This place is a nice respite. They help take the pain out of long trips. Enjoy!
"Comfortable and large lounge. The range of food for breakfast was reasonable. There were eggs, waffle, pastries, et. The internet speed was reasonable. We sat at a table on an elevated platform and I found it a little startling as I got off. I almost tripped each time. There was no warning of the step."
"For people that don't check lounge reviews-- here's your best kept secret about this lounge... if you are not flying first class, you don't have access to Flagship First dining.  You can settle for the standard buffet offerings if you turn to the left, or you can go to the right and sit at the bridge area.  In here, you get a special menu that you can order from.  Much better food and wine options than what you can get from the buffet line."
"Third first class domestic flight in six weeks, does American Airlines believe in service?"
"Pretty decent lounge and a step up from the standard Admirals Clubs in terms of complimentary booze and better grub!  This lounge is located in JFK's Terminal 8, just past security and easy to get to.  The buffet is pretty extensive with a choice of a couple of hot soups, hot entrees (chicken, fish, and beef), salads, side dishes, and desserts.  I enjoyed a cup of minestrone and an entree of chicken with mushroom gravy, gratineed cauliflower, and a barley pilaf.  If you have a night flight and want to take advantage of the full flight for sleeping, then there's enough offerings here for a solid dinner to forgo the on-board service.  The lounge has a blessed quiet room as the main lounge can be a bit noisy - as it was on this visit which was rather full and lots of kids running about.  But certainly a refined and civilized oasis in which to relax and chill before a long overseas flight!"
"Ever since they merged with US Air it's been one disastrous trip after another. Our flight was supposed to take off from JFK Friday March 2nd at 9:30 am. At that time it was only drizzling. Unfortunately the first officer was a no show. The pilot was willing to fly to Punta Cana with just 2 crew members and pick up a pilot in the Dominican Republic. American Airlines made us wait for a new first officer to show up. They boarded us knowing they did not have a complete flight crew then had to de-plane us after 45 minutes. After another hour waiting at the gate they re-boarded us, even though the 3rd crew member had not yet arrived. We sat at the gate for 2 hours watching the weather deteriorate to heavy snow and 50mph winds. The new first officer finally arrived but because of the weather we had to be de-iced. So we waited another hour. Finally we pushed back from the gate and taxied for what seemed like 10 miles only to find out there were 13 planes ahead of us. They had to wait for the winds to die down before they would let a plane take off. So, in the end our 9:30am departure time turned into 2:30pm. They cheated us out of 5 hours at the resort our first day. Our return flight was only slightly better, leaving 90 minute later than expected.  WE flew out of JFK instead of Philly because we used our miles and it seems American Airlines like to punish people using their miles. A flight out of Philly to Punta Cana would have cost us 120k miles so we were forced to fly out of JFK for 60k miles. In the future, if we can avoid flying American Airlines, we will most definitely do so."
From LAX to JFK MARTIE AND JOEY ON FLIGHT 118 from LAX to JFK you rocked TODAY!!Everything I needed with a smile and nothing but friendly in every traveled mile.Sitting in economy? You won't notice when these two are working your section.Keep it up AA!!XO
"I'll just stick with Yelp's A-OK for AA. Just like any other airline I've had my share of delays with them. I usually try not to check luggage, however when I have with them, it's never been lost or too delayed.While arriving at JFK this last weekend I lost my phone, and some very kind person returned it to security, then it went to some AA employee, which answered the phone and said they were going to bring it to their lost and found. Which they didn't do right away, then it went to TSA, and then I have no idea. Of course I didn't realize this until I was on my way to my hotel. So after checking in I went to an Apple store for help to activate all the lost, and play a sound, settings. (Review for Apple employee coming).So yes, AA managed to get my cell phone back to me, although it could have been smoother, AA lost and found sent me back up to TSA, TSA allowed me to call my phone, after begging. Conversation was, I was told you have it, no we don't, okay, then just let me call it, someone keeps picking it up. Call phone, oh it's where? AA..lost and found, where I made my very first stop. A big thank you and hug to the kind person that turned it in. As for AA, they need to streamline the system, there were a few of us running the same bases. I'm usually very good about checking that I have everything before leaving an area, however, being human it happens"
