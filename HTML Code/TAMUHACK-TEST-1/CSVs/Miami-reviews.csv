"My flight from Miami to JFK, was not awful, but I do have a bone or two to pick about the Miami based crew. The crew that ""took care"" of the business class section did not deliver the type of service I pay for when traveling business and first class- even for domestic. The attitudes and faces from these ladies was just outrageous. If you don't like your occupation or the company you work for, please do yourself a favor and leave. This is a customer forward job, and customer service is the name of the game. There was no hello or good morning upon entry. I was told I needed to put my headphone case away, while  the person to the left and right of me had more than a few items on their own table. We were not offered, not even a glass of water before departure. And then had to wait about an hr into the flight for a cup of coffee and our ""meal""; charcuterie platter for breakfast. The gentleman before me was the last to receive the omelet platter. Why aren't there enough meal selections for everyone?? Hello! People are paying a premium for a reason. While we were eating, the attendants would not stop circling to collect plates, normally you'd think this was a good thing, but it was definitely a rushed service and many of us (my husband and a friend) felt pressured to eat quickly.As stated previously, I fly Delta and it's partners 98% of the time. This is part of the reason why. I can't say I would write off AA altogether, but I am saying that service needs to be improved and there needs to be a standard set across the board. One person having a bad day is understandable, but an entire crew? To add insult to injury, the smiles and personalities change the minute they have to go around and get you to sign up for their credit card. I took one application and noticed they each have a code on the back, with the flight attendants name. Of course..."
"Terminal D has a nice selection of stores, food vendors and lounges, which includes the admirals lounge just one level up from D15. It's a rather large terminal so make sure you aren't running late for your flight. I have no complaints with American, even though I travel Delta and it's partners 98% of the time."
"American Airlines is the worst. I typically fly Southwest but of course they don't go to Colombia, sad face. So I was stuck with AA. I was hassled by an AA lady checking in on my way to CTG about having some visa forms filled out. I'm only going for seven days, why would I need a visa?I told her to just check me in. If there's an issue the computer will alert her. Of course, there was no issue eye roll.Coming back home was even worse. So the plane leaving Cartagena was delayed causing everyone on the plane to miss their connecting flight. I had to rebook my flight for the following day.The hotel AA assigned us to was disgusting and there was no shuttle transportation to and from the Miami airport. Overall terrible experience. I would have been better off using Spirit."
"I was traveling out of country and my phone broke. Showed up for my flight back, and the only thing they could say was ""computer down, not our fault, you get nothing, take this flight or stay here"". So I could either accept their offer or stay somewhere I didn't speak the language with no phone or contacts. Came back to US and was told the best they could do was have me wait in the hospital for days until the next flight. The computer glitch was fixed well before my flight. I get it will impact other flights, but I watched them use all of their desk agents in Columbia to help a family for over two hours, until the line at the airport was out of the door. Even tho flights were delayed, I could have gotten on an earlier delayed flight; however this could not happen due to their incompetence. They refused to work with me just saying that ""I shouldn't have missed my flight"". Which never happened, it was them who delayed it. Will not be fly with them again."
"American is one of the lowest of the low on my ratings consistently bc of their poor adherence to any sort of schedule when it comes to flights being on time, or any kind of accountability for it whatsoever.  Their phrase of choice is, ""Come back tomorrow!""  Are you kidding me?!?  When people have booked and paid for trips, excursions and cars?  That's absolutely unacceptable.  They're awful. Consistently one of the worst airlines in my experience.  I avoid them at all costs unless they happen to be the only airline flying to a destination I have to go to for work or personal.  Unfortunately, that was the case recently so I was forced to fly with them. This once, our flights had no major issues.  But still, poor choice of snacks and planes are getting worse and worse as far as space and comfort.  Additionally, we sat in business class on the last leg of our travel and they don't even have TVs in the headrests anymore - you are encouraged to log into their website on your own device.   How lazy can you be?!  Now I have to bring my own entertainment as well. Soon I think I might have to bring my own wings and pay them for the pleasure of flying myself somewhere...."
"We thought JetBlue succeeded in establishing  the low bar for airline customer appreciation and servive. Sadly, American Airlines wants to join them with an egregiously poor customer service policy. We purchased international tickets, arriving back at our destination (PVD in this case) around 10 pm. That's about as late as we would consider, when we selected these tickets. We booked the tickets with extra space seating at a cost of about $1,200 each, up at least 30% from about 18 months ago. Thus far, no problem, our ticket purchase was confirmed on September 12th.A couple of days ago, American cancelled one of the return segments, and changed our flight to arrive at 12:11 a.m., meaning we wouldn't get back home unitl about 1:30 a.m. We didn't want to return that late, and called AA Customer Service, and got through promptly (that was a pleasant surprise). Henry in customer service was very polite and helpful, well at least he tried to be helpful. He could not find better routing, so he cancelled our flight. And herein lies the problem.AA'S STANDARD POLICY IS TO ISSUE A CREDIT, NOT REFUND THE PURCHASE!THIS IS COMPLETELY UNFAIR, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE CANNOT FIX THIS. INSTEAD YOU MUST FILE A REQUEST ON THEIR WEBSITE - NOT EASY TO FIND THAT URL) AND THEY WILL REVIEW IT WITHIN 10 DAYS), AND THEY DO NOT SAY YOU WILL GET A REFUND.I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL USE AA FOR THE TRIP, IT DEPENDS ON ROUTING. SO I DON'T KNOW IF/WHEN I'LL BE ABLE TO USE A $2,400 CREDIT.IF AIRLINE CANCELS YOUR FLIGHT AND CANNOT PROVIDE ACCEPTABLE ROUTING THEY SHOULD REFUND YOU MONEY, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. ASSUMING I DO GET A REFUND, THAT'S A LOT OF WORK AND HASSLE FOR AN ISSUE THEY CREATED.Congratulations American Airlines, you have succeeded in ticking off another customer with an appallingly unfair customer service policy (and I'm a Million Mile Flyer with AA - you'd think loyalty would be reciprocal)."
"I was out of town for several months for elective rotations, and some took me out of the U.S. My trek eastward was made possible by American Airlines. My trek back home, the same.While the trek was inevitably long and tiring, there were some things that AA could have done better.For one, they could stock actual food. I don't mind paying for it, as long as it's food, and not a cheap version of a lunchable (throwback to elementary school). The snacks are low-quality, and are most definitely NOT worth the price. For the nation's largest airline, I expected better.On the flip side, the drinks were ok. But it is hard to mess that up. They also had tasty cinnamon crackers on one leg of my trip, so that was good.Their agent at the counter wanted to double-charge me for my check-in bags. I politely explained to her that I already paid for the bags from where I first began my homebound journey. She insisted I had to pay again, until I showed her my documents. I guess she say my other credentials, so she stopped insisting. But that was pretty ridiculous attempt at nickel-and-diming me.The flight staff was great, however. The stewardesses were very friendly, and even took the time to get me extra coffee and cinnamon crackers when I requested them. I would say that AA out of Miami Int'l Airport runs around the average, hence the 3-stars. They should train their agents at the check-in counter better, and get actual food options on the plane, and they would be golden."
"TRASH. They get you on plane, THEN delay your plane THREE TIMES with ZERO explanation. Kept us all trapped on plane parked at gate for over an hour. Garbage airline. Pathetic."
What a nasty and disrespectful group of people in charge of this airline.No one has any manners and speak to everyone like we are trash.Even if you try to be polite they will just dog you with mean sometimes cuss words.
Please share my original post on fb bc American airlines obviously messed up and won't admit it!!!American Airlines is a crap company. My friend landed in Cancun (flight 2835 from Austin) and her passport fell out of her backpack upon landing. She went back to the gate to check the plane and they wouldn't let her. They claimed they cleaned the plane and checked 3x and it was no where on site.Ironically I had a friend on the same plane going back in my to Austin from Cancun (flight 2835) the flight right after them. And these passengers (not employees) found her passport at her seat upon landing back in Austin. American Airlines didn't check the plane like they said And obviously didn't clean the plane as Covid friendly as they say they are. Upon asking American Airline if they could find her passport in the airplane they held her up in customs for hours and made her cry and questioned her constantly. Treating her as a criminal. They finally agreed to fly her back on a flight to America in Dallas with security and made her spend the night in the airport customs (not even a hotel) until they could get her on a flight back to Austin at 8:30 in the morning. When we informed them we had friends that found her passport they disregarded us and continued to be rude. Yes I understand it was her mistake for misplacing her passport but it is absolute trash that they would treat somebody like that. Much less not look for her passport with she said she left it.  All of us have could've been avoided if they found her passport where she said it was left. Now she has been treated like a criminal and missed out on a $2000 trip because American was too lazy to look where they were supposed to look.
Airlines we're great when they were regulated by the government. They all had to charge the same fare and had to compete for your business. Not anymore. Today you're treated like cattle and everything is an extra fee. First class SUCKS!

Flight wasnt bad and pilot got here half an hour early. Seats are kinda cozy so hopefully you'll  get along with the person sitting next to you. Check in was easy and the wait to board went smoothly. Your provided refreshments twice on the plane ( about an hour after you board and an hour before you land) biscuit cookies are provided but that's about it so bring your own treats.  Free wifi is also available just follow the steps and just try to relax and enjoy the flight
"We have been told flight will take off 90 minutes late, leaving Miami , for paperwork to be filled out.  Pay more for poor service.   Sadly this airline is a shell of what it use to be.  Only flying this airline when  nothing else is available.  Unfortunately Jet blue chose to merge with American. I only see American Air dragging jet blue down rather than jet blue lifting American Air up. I really wish could say something positive. I do have more time to read."
"Here is to the importance of reading the fine print. Is it to travel from Connecticut to Miami. After looking at a  Is variety of airports and airlines I chose American on a Boston, which was a 2 plus our ride, because they had access to a lounge that allowed me to drive early be sure I could get there and when leaving my meeting in Miami get to the airport early enough given traffic issues and again have access to the launch.Now I paid up for 1st class which was an excellent experience flying out of Boston to Miami. And part of that was when I got to Boston I showed my boarding pass and the lounge let me in period perfect! So with great anticipation I arrived in Miami, early so I could charge phones do some paperwork and relax and only have to walk a few gates to the flight no hassle no problem. Surprise! And I clicked further on the access to the lounge I would have realized and been told that either for a fee for a-day pass or a membership I could get it. Yeah though I thought I was going to be a great new fan of American Airlines but it's about the total process and being disappointed here sitting on the floor kind of took all that away from me.OK, I get it not so fair to give them a low rating given that I didn't read all the details. But after the great experience in Boston, you can imagine my disappointment here in Miami come people were friendly they just stood by the rules and I'm just upset with myself."
Nor sure if I'll be using them in the future.  Our plane was delayed almost 2 hours because they didn't have a flight crew.  How are you going to book flights and not guarantee a crew?
"Horrible customer service. We landed in Miami and checked the AA app for our gate. We ran a mile to another concourse only to be told it was another gate over a mile away. Needless to say, we didn't make our flight. Customer service at the gate wouldn't lift a finger to help us.Fly with someone else."
"Just checked in for my flight to LAX, first class. was told at check in that I could use the Flagship lounge. went to the lounge and was denied access. Apparently only some flights across the US are ""qualified"" for access, even in First Class! The flight I booked was originally eligible but the plane was changed to one that only has 2, not 3 classes!  Currently sitting in a very crowded airport with no lounge access."
Wonderful service and check in thank you Miguel Mena for being so friendly! We will definitely be flying American again and coming back to Miami!
This airline has Long waits and Is extremely unorganized. It's dirty and cold. Total disaster!
"They almost had me convinced that LAS - (Las Vegas) American Airlines is just the ugly red headed stepchild of a exception but unfortunately AA even in Miami isnt exempt from the utter disorganization and general thinking of one step ahead and not backwards planning so the consequences land straight on the customers head.  I do have to say the check in process here did go smoothly.  You won't believe this but they actually had a person waiting BEFORE you get in line to tell you where to go or give you directions.  I was honestly surprised (I'm not even joking).  The rep then asked if I downloaded the appropriate app and had all the info I needed.  I proceeded to where he told me and I got thru the line easy peasy lemon squeezy.  I went to the Centurion Lounge and was thinking wow it's just Las Vegas AA that's crappy but now as I'm sitting here 1 hour late into my vacation on this stinky plane in business class ): because AA can get thier schedules, airplanes, landings etc.  Nothing about this airline is good.  Absolutely nothing.  Only good thing about this airline is the tickets are getting heaper because no one wants to fly with them anymore so eventually some other airline will buy them and fix this epic failure as an airline.This is probably the most negative I have ever been on a Yelp review!"
"Well, two years later and the service I have been experiencing has been getting better. Not perfect, but flight attendants are treating me with a smile and helping me with luggage and other items. The boarding lately has been quicker and more efficient."
"I'm not the biggest fan of these guys. Many of the employees here at the check-in desks, and working on the aircraft, are some of the most unfriendly individuals you will come across. I always wonder why management keeps them around.  I guess providing good customer service doesn't seem to be part of their job description. Today, while we all were sitting in our seats, a rude maintenance guy came on board looking on the floor and under seats. He didn't say anything, but order several people to get out of their seat, especially an elderly lady who he never even helped. I asked him what he was looking for and he just gave me a rude look and said, ""something"". After causing a stir, he then just left frustrated. Perhaps we could have helped him if he communicated a bit better."
"Not sure what to call it, but Flight AA1017 has 6 black men and a black woman sitting in the exit row and the older male flight attendant walked up and demanded EVERYONE's ticket claiming ""this is premium seating, we need to make sure you're all in your right seat!""  Ain't that a bitch!!!!?  So wait, I've NEVER had this demanded of me in my 33 years of flying.  This guy must have retired from United Airlines and joined AA. UNBELIEVABLE!!!! Oh yeah, he ate crow when he apologized and said his ipad didn't show these rows occupied. Even if it didn't, the flight is no where near full, so honestly, it doesn't matter does it?  We all agreed to assist in the event of an emergency, I guess these large fellas should just fend for themselves (ourselves), but we are bigger than that..."
"If I could give this airline zero stars I would. Flight got de-boarded on our way to a short vacation due to a pilot error, which caused us to miss our connecting flight that had a 3 hour layover...The representatives to help us rebook and find vouchers were unbelievably unhelpful and unsympathetic to our situation. One representative was immediately hostile with my girlfriend for asking a simple rebooking question. Once at our layover destination, we could not get an American Airlines employee to help us with getting a hotel voucher. In fact they kept funneling us to different people who refused to help us. In the end we were forced to beg a representative over the phone for accommodations. Once we arrived at the hotel, the front desk told us there were no rooms available. Again, was forced to beg for help. American overbooked the hotel, which was not the hotel's fault. Almost every plane I've been on this trip included maintenance delays. All in all, this is the crappiest airline to fly on. Shoot, I would fly spirit before ever booking with this airline again."
Not my favorite airline but it's ok.  The bathrooms are clean And the restaurant options are great. The employees 1 out 5 are about a 3. Not the friendliest.
"Ok, we are still in pandemic mode wearing face masks.Social distancing??? The plane was packed like a can of sardines 3/3 rows.On the trip down to Miami not even water was offered. Bad weather delayed our flight the crew was tops and very helpful.The pilot tried avoiding turbulence without luck, yet he delivered us safe to our destination."
Long terminal
I travel nearly every month. I stay away from American as much as I can as you will experience moreDelays and missed connections. It took 3 flights and 2 days to get me from Colorado to Florida with 2 of the 3 flight having delays causing a missed connection. Extra 300 in expenses as I had to spend a night in Dallas. I paid for business class and they only gave it to me on one of the flights so whatever that costs as well. Their up there with spirit as the worst airline in the US period. I would rather Delta and fly to a further away city and drive a rental car. I would have been home before they could have flown me there.
We just got our very bad experience with American Airlines. They gave our seats to other ppl 15 mn before the plane left and told us we were too late.  We had to buy more tickets and stay in the airport for 10 h to land in a total different airport. So disappointed.  And now I have to found a way to get a refund for the tickets and the extra money to get better seats. and not a stupid credit. I can't believe it. I feel so bad for my kids to have to deal with this :(
"The most unbelievably unhelpful people in the airline industry! What an awesome job though!!! Just stand 20 feet from the self check-in kiosk and point. Don't say anything, just point. Full-time job: proficient and RBF and pointing.Seriously, I know I am salty but 4 check-ins for my trip and every single AA airport employee bar none at all was just horrid.Just one case (besides the incessant pointing) was this:I saw a woman self check and got her bag tag and walked off.  I noticed she left her boarding pass in the machine.  I grabbed it and ran her down to give it to her.  I return to my wife who is self checking to find out the attendant next to the machine saw it as well and chastised my wife because I should not have handled the other woman's pass.  SHE WAS COMPLETELY AWARE THE WOMAN LEFT IT THERE AND DID NOTHING!!!Sorry, I don't usually ""all caps"" but this whole thing left me heaping mad...I'm giving 2 stars just because at least two flight attendants gave my wife ""crew member wings"" because she was goofy enough to ask.  They were cool."
"American Airlines doesn't give a shit what people say. As long as they're making money. The absolute WORST flight attendants on the planet. Always frowning and in a bad mood. Could this be why so many people revolt on their flights.I am SO glad I don't have to fly this airline so often. Sadly, they're better than United.Majors are terrible... So is Sprit (AKA thug express)."
"My family and I traveled from SF to FL.Both arms going and returning, the plane had very little air flow throughout the flight.  The returning flight was the worst.  I am normally cold on flights and dress for it, but this time I continuously sweated.  My husband's fan was out of order, so he wasn't getting much circulation at all.  With having to wear the mask, it just makes things worse.  It didn't help that our flight was delayed and they had to pull a plane that was sitting in the heat all day.I get Covid protocols, but little air flow on newer 737s doesn't make any sense."
"Late departing LAX today, then spent 30 minutes sitting on the tarmac at the Miami airport waiting for Gate to clear so the plane could park. Totally unsatisfactory delays."
