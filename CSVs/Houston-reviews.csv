"It's  crazy all over. But, to have what is the face of your airline. The ticket counter person. Too  Just be rude and tell me. And I quote ""we are not doing Southwest passengers and to go back to Southwest "" in of quote. She said several other rude things. Like my name is  Marie. When I ask why she being rude. She said your welcome. Did she feel comfortable and empowered because I'm a black man or because she has been allowed to  embarrass and disrespect a potential customer. Marie needs training when dealing with potential American airlines customers. American airlines ticket counter at Houston Hobby airport."
Just the name of the airport should give some clue. But AA is the worst!! Have to spend the night in Dallas because of their screw up.
F American Airline and everybody that work there. Trash ass customer service and staffing who don't care about peoples well-being
Suck!!!! Never again will I fly with them. Don't waste your money upgrading your seat... good luck getting your connection!
"I see why people dislike American Airlines. Poor quality fleet. Service sucks. They give you a super hard time if your bags aren't the right size or a pound over weight. Now for flight timeliness, I took a one-way flight from Houston to Philadelphia. A rip off of a fare. I now sit at the gate still waiting to pull back. This plane had been here for hours and when it was boarding time, it was too hot inside and had to get cooled. I've never experienced such a thing. A 255p departure is now approaching 4p. Flight 2311. I'd say skip American Airlines.Oh wow, as I write this, I believe they just announced they have a flat tire.On my return to Houston, I am taking Frontier. Let's see..."
What a joke. Changes gates to 3 different terminals in 3 hours. All seats are extra$$ except the ones way way in the back. Even middle seats cost extra! Ripoff. Garbage.
I was at the Houston Texas aAirport today 6/25/22 I was sitting down in the American Airlines side department A when a small man Mexican  about 4 ft. tall walked passed me and said I had a hit. Then he came out of the bathroom and looked like he wanted to kill me. As I walked toward the elevator a few minutes later the pilots that were standing there  said repeadedly quote she has a hit. It's evident that the staff are criminals at American Airlines. Maybe that's why their corporate office is in Phoenix Arizona a mob state where they kill woman in broad daylight. Their employees in Arizona are all snitches for crime families. Beware of American Airlines.
"If I could leave a review with less than one star that is what I would be given. I don't normally right reviews but my flight from DFW to IAH was the worst experience I have had with an airline company period. I tend to fly Southwest due to the two free bags but my boyfriend had planned out the PERFECT birthday cruise which started with two first class tickets to Houston on American Airlines. We were originally scheduled to leave at 10am yesterday morning that flight got cancelled and we were moved to 7am. It was earlier then we planned but whatever we were too ex it's not to move frwd. We get to the airplane everyone boards and we had out to get  the plane treated for ice. After over an hour the plane has been treated but a mechanical error has popped up. We return to the gate? Deplane and are told our new plane is ready to go.  Everyone boards the plane and we are told we are now last in line to have the plane treated for ice and no one knows when we will head back out. After multiple flight delay messages and conversations we are told willHave to exit the plane again. At this point it's around 10 am. I politely asked the flight attendees/co-polite if we can please just get our bags so we can make the drive to Houston and still make our boat. I was told because they were delaying the flight and not cancelling it that this wouldn't be an option. They continued to delay the flight another  hour and a half before allowing us to re-board.  Once back on the plane we are told we can head out for the ice treatment but we still have no clue what place in line we are. As we think we are heading back out we're told we need more fuel so we have to wait just a few minutes to get topped off. That few minutes turns to 45. At this point I'm 95% sure we will be missing our boat... but regardless we have to stay in the plane because our luggage is going to IAH with or without us. When we finally leave it's well after 1pm. We got into Houston at 2:20ish and our boat was leaving from Galveston at 4 with a 3:30 hard door close. They took 20 more minutes to unload my baggage even though it wAs marked first class priority!!! Needless to say after a $220 cab ride to attempt to make the boat my boyfriend and I were in Galveston watching our boat sail away. Another $100 Uber ride later we were in Houston with no room, car or plan. Around 4pm I called customer relations and reservations for a call back due to an overload in calls. That call was suppose to come within the next 4 hours (8:30pm) at the latest. I was just woke up out of my sleep at 4:30am by a reservation representative that could cancel my flight with no promise of a refund but could help in no other way. I was told to try back customer relations at 8 am when they open. This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE and I'm disgusted with how this entire process was handle by American Airlines. They have been the primary airlines we use for travel at the company I work for and when I return to our executive meetings next week I'll be STRONGLY suggesting that we reconsider who we do business with."
"I'm so disappointed today with this airlines. I went from delayed 65 minutes less than 45 minutes to boarding to straight turmoil (4 hours ). This was my first time flying American and they left such a horrible impression. With their  airplanes having countless issues grounding them, to over booking flights,  and terrible customer service I don't know how they are still around. I rarely rate 1 star so this is quite new for me, but people please beware of traveling via this airlines.What to expect: 1. They alter your original flight, creating longer flights 2. They create ridiculously long layovers 6-8 hours3. Change gates frequently leading up to boarding4. Their planes don't seem to be well maintained causing more delays5. Barely assist you with changes due to air plane issues 6. You have to make a semi/big scene to be given compensation for their delaysPlan an extra day of travel when using them, I lost almost 2 days of vacation because of airline issues that resulted in nonrefundable activities/dinners that were booked for up to 6 hours after I should have landed. Such a disappointment."
They blew it this time. My flight from Houston to dfw was late by an hour which caused me to miss my connecting flight. The next flight out to my final destination is 8:45pm. 6 hour delay. I will probably never use American Airlines again. Beware if you have a tight connecting flight. You will more than likely miss if flying American. They run late. That's how they roll. Lesson learned. Give yourself at least two hours to connect. If not you will be stuck. The lady working the counter put me on a flight to New Orleans. Luckily I checked and was able to get it fixed in DFW. So incompetent. You will be better off with any other airline. As you can see four years ago my previous reviews had the same bs issues. I am done with this airline.
So far I have to rate a 1. I was supposed to leave at 945am and my flight was delayed till 1215 which will make me miss my next flight from Dallas. I called and was able to get on an earlier flight. The ladies working the front desk were really nice. So far it started off bad but if I make my next connecting flight since they were able to move me up I will change my rating. Imagine though if they were not able to reroute me. I would be on a 6 hour delay. Good god!OK I held my word. The got me in an earlier flight and got me to my destination.5 starsAnother update. No issues from Chicago to Houston. Slight 30 min delay for take off bc of paint missing but we were able to still make it on time to Houston. Will use again
Trash airline trash service trash travel Will never fly them again and pilot lied so many times just ridiculous
Flight got canceled leaving a lot of people scrambling to find alternate arrangements. The indifference of the agents made it even worse. One agent left her post instead of helping the long line of people find alternate flights.
"Terrible. My sons flight out of Houston was delayed four hours, so it was difficult to find anyone to help me book a flight for the next day. An employee at the gate looked me up and down and just walked away. I followed, as I needed to change my sons flight. She went to a gathering of the other employees at another gate, to discuss bracelets for about 15 minutes before anyone could help me. The airplanes offer no food or beverages, no modern technology and their club stinks. The employees are hit or miss. I'm just sticking with United for now on,"
"I'm not always pleased with the cleanliness and comfort in coach. ( maybe it's ""post Coronavirus"" precautions), but this trip, the aircraft appeared to be well-cleaned. TIP- don't leave your health to others; I wiped down everything I anticipated handling, and wore a hospital mask because apparently some travers still like to hack, sneeze, and cough open-mouthed or into their hands. Don't ask me to SHAKE YOUR HAND, dodo"
Most hopeless airlines. I had to fly from Dallas DFW airlines to Houston Hobby airlines on12/26/2021 at 10:30 am flight. Got email confirmation that flight was on time before leaving Hotel. Spend $20 on taxi to reach hotel. Flight is delayed by 30 minutes then by 2 hours they changed gate then by another 4 hours. Made me miss my work got chewed by my boss thanks to them spend another $12 to get something to eat had to request friend to pick up who spend his own time gas and $2 for airport entry to pick me up spend another $48 to pick up my own car from Hobby Airport in total landed up paying more than $250 for flight of this airlines which I had to cancel. Then to ask for refund there is no human being just website to process refund. If you have crew shortage then you need to hire more folks make sure they are fully vaccinated and follow all precautions. I will never fly on this expensive airlines ever but rather fly more organized cheaper Southwest Airlines where I never had any such issues at all. Totally disappointed and dissatisfied passengerVivek Sharma
"Word to the wise ... avoid American Eagle especially into LAX and the American Eagle terminal. Spent 3.5 hours on a flight into LA with no wifi, tvs, food or alcohol. Note sure why since our United flight to the initial leg to pur destination  had food, wifi, tvs and beer and wine. So then landed at this terminal only having to walk through covered walkways to arrive at a packed zoo of a terminal and a huge line up with a 50 minute wait for a shuttle that was packed shoulder to shoulder to the main terminal. Could they not have more or bigger shuttles?? Did I mention charging us $100 extra for a bag that was 4lbs overweight? Next time I kno to avoid AA"
"My least favourite airline to fly when I have a choice. Seems like every time there is an issue with flying, it happens to be American Airlines. Any where from delays, lost bags, etc. Their customer service is lacking as well. Compared to the other major airlines, they never seem to want to try to help solve a problem. During the flights too, they are inconsistent with communicating with the passengers, whether it is turbulence, delays, etc. My last choice for sure."
"had the worst experience of my life due to how air-hostess Liz treated me on AA flight 1393. I have GI health issues, Gastritis, and gastrointestinal reflux disease. I was prescribed meds to control my conditions. I take my meds around 6 to 6.30 p.m; daily due to the 12-hour interval from the first dose. Around 6 p.m, my husband, who was sitting next to me, motioned Liz and said, excuse me, and asked her for a cup of water as I have to have liquid to take my meds. Liz was right behind our isle, passing out earbuds. Without even letting my husband finish, she said, wait your turn in a loud, scolding voice as she assumed he was trying to ask for earbuds without waiting his turn. She approached us next and said how many in regards to the earbuds. My husband immediately asked if my wife can get some water to take her meds. Liz said, not right now, because the pilot just announced for us to get up (which didn't even make any sense as she was already up so she can also get water). She handed earbuds without even waiting for our reply and walked away. I was trying to wait till she got to serving drinks, but my stomach started burning, and I realized I need to take the meds. Again, my husband said, excuse me and asked for Liz to come over. Liz appeared very angry,and she said I already told you that I just got up due to the pilot's order, and you need to wait. Then, I reached over and said, ma'am, I understand what you are saying, but this is a medical emergency, and showed my medicine bottle, which had all my information on there, and said I need water to take my meds. She made a loud exasperated sound and threw her hands in the air, and walked off. A few minutes later, another air hostess gave me a cup of water. The whole flight, I was shaken up and very sad that someone can treat another human being, especially a customer, in such a degrading, demeaning manner. Liz needs to be held accountable,and she should never treat another customer like that again.PLEASE follow up"
"The worst airline ever! I lost my drivers license in the Phoenix (American Airline) airport. American contacts me via email to let me know that they can return if I pay 30.00 for fed ex Hello, it's only 11.00 to replace my Texas license. Common curtesy would be dropping it in a USPS mailbox so they can return but no!!!!My flight from Houston to Dallas was late. I had to  take a 3 hour later flight to a diff destination because I was not going to make my connecting flight. However on the way home, we waited on the plane for an hour while we waited so others could make their connecting flight. What the hell! I had to rebook but we wait for an hour on the plane so other people can make their flight! I will never book with American Airline again. They suck ! Absolutely rotten experience ever! Spirit has better service hands down over these people!!!!!"
"Flew first class from Philadelphia to Houston on 6/6/21. This was the worse experience I've had on an airplane. I have never flew first class so I expected a little more then I would in the main cabin. Boy was I wrong. The flight attendant was rude and to busy playing on her phone. They offered a single bag of potato chips and a warm beer. She came around one time to take a drink order and one time to offer a bag of chips. We received our two beers and both were warm and not drinkable. This was a complete waste of money and I am not looking forward to my first class flight coming up in July to Florida. Save yourself the money and fly the main cabin, first class is highly overrated and a monumental waste of money."
"This airline It's just organized, Council's regular flights, if you have a connecting flight you're lucky if you even catch it. They have canceled over three flights this year, getting stuck at the airport for about 16 hours, their stuff on the plane usually is very rude, good luck getting to your destinations if you take this airline. Very understaffed, if you have any questions or need any assistance they will keep it on hold for hours and hours and hours."
"LOL EVERYONE from TSA to the Flight Attendants had a damn attitude! It was actually laughable that their staff is THAT rude. Wow. Don't fly with them, I don't care if it costs $2. It's not worth it."
"The absolute WORST!  They are batting  a thousand. 100% travel mess up on every single flight with this airline. I will travel hours out of my way to avoid American Airlines from this day forward. Worst of all are their ticketing agents. They have absolutely zero compassion or care of the wellbeing of their guests.If I could give half or zero stars, they have earned it yet again today."
"Terrible, terrible customer service during checkout at terminal A, 12/7 11:00am. Terrible attitude, unhelpful by one lady receiving tagged bags, perhaps helping people is not her vocation"
"So my flight from Seattle to Dallas has been loaded to the gills with passengers and sitting at the gate for an hour now past departure time because the ground crew left without unloading luggage from the incoming flight, much less loading luggage for our flight. A new marker for airline incompetence."
This is AA airlines. The only plus side to it I can think of is that they have AA advantage points. And they do fly out quite frequent so u end up getting tickets or a flight that works on your own schedule with them. Other than that service is hit and miss. I mean its ok. Ride can be bumpy at times but that is weather dependent too.Also no free lunch or breakfast unlike some of its competitor.
"Very disappointed. They canceled the flight and put me on a flight for the next day. I am losing a day at by hotel and losing my tour. I won't get any refunds and American Airlines days call the 800 number to see if we could do anything. The crew are basically computerized to repeat only one sentence, we don't help in person anymore. Waiting on the phone for 3 hours with no end I. Site to anyone picking up my call.... Not even worth one star!!! But I have to pick one."
"If I could give zero stars, I would. AA is the most incompetent airlines I've ever had to deal with. I booked flights four months in advance to Houston from LAX, both flights there and back were direct flights. Got a decent price for them, should have known it was going to be an issue because of the price, ""You get what you pay for."" So I get an email on July 7th, 2019 saying that both my flights have been changed. My flight there was a changed to a later departed and arrival time than what was originally booked, which was inconvenient because I had some things planned for when I arrived in Houston. Now that my arrival time was later, I was landing at 11pm and having to pick up my car and go to my hotel, it was almost 1am. So my first day was ruined because they decided to randomly change my flight. But I didn't think much of it and just went along with it, because what am I supposed to do? The real problem was the departure flight back home to California. It was a literally nightmare. Our flight departure time was 1:48pm. Got to the airport around 12pm to go through TSA and be ready on time to board. When we got there and sat down waiting, they delayed our flight. No problem, things happen sometimes, but then they delayed my flight once more, again, I was okay with it because maybe this would be the last delay then we would finally get on a plane and take off...but no, they cancelled it. They cancelled my direct flight home from Houston to LAX. I had to go over to the booking counter to rebook my flight which was a total zoo because there were about 20 people ahead of me. I rebooked my flight and was able to get on a flight that afternoon but with a connection in Dallas. The airplane arrives for the flight to Dallas. Me and all the passengers make our way onto the plane. We sit on the plane for about and hour and a half. The pilot speaks onto the intercom two times stating that we can't take off because he's waiting for a log book. We sit on the plane for almost TWO HOURS. Finally, they deplane us. They now say that the plane we are on is going to take off at 8:00pm. So I wait. 8pm comes around and they change the take off time to 10pm!!! At this point, it's 8pm and we've been at the airport since 12pm. I'm tired and I have work the next day which I had to call in and miss because the incompetence of American Airlines. Because this plane didn't take off, I missed my connecting flight in Dallas to LAX.At this point, I just decided to ask American Airlines to comp us a hotel and start all over again the next day. They compensated our hotel and rebooked our flights. They were nice enough to do that but the kicker is...two couples who were in the exact same situation we were in regarding the direct flight being cancelled and being rebooked on the flight where we sat there for two hours, they didn't get their hotel compensated. American wouldn't compensate their hotel. Why would they do that for us and not for them if they were in the exact situation? I felt so bad for them. The agents for American kept making excuse after excuse as to why they wouldn't compensate them a hotel. It was absolutely ridiculous.So, the next day we started over. We had our flights booked. When I get to the airport, my flight is DELAYED AGAIN, to the point where I was going to miss my connecting flight in Dallas, this is the next day! I had to go to the agents AGAIN to have them put me on an earlier flight so I wouldn't miss my connecting flight in Dallas. And you guessed it...that flight too was delayed. It was a literal nightmare. Even though it was delayed, I was still able to make my connecting flight in Dallas. Finally made it to Dallas and you guessed it, that flight was delayed as well. Only it wasn't that stressful because it was just the flight back home so I didn't have to make any connecting flights. When I get to baggage claim at LAX, I get a text saying that 1 of my 2 checked bags is delayed. We only checked one bag at the gate because they wouldn't allow our bag in the overhead compartment because the flight was full and they didn't have any room. The bag then arrives at baggage claim. How do you mess that up?On top of it all, the flight attendants aren't that nice...they are just okay.This is definitely a failing airlines that I don't see being in business much longer. If they can't even keep from having that amount of delays and mishaps, how can't they stay in business?I will never ever fly AA ever again. I learned my lesson with this one. I will tell everyone I know to never fly American. I am done.I'm flying Delta or Southwest from now on. I rather pay more and know my flights are going to be on time. American Airlines, you suck!"
"It was most horrible experience that I has while traveling domestically. The seats are so close to your knee it is not even funny, and lucky I am not that tall.  But beside that the flight attendants are like they don't want to be there and you as a customer just a bother to them. They are not there to serve you but just to babysit you.  The airplanes are in a sad shape there was delay after delay and gate changes like a roulette wheel.  For a elderly person they don't offer any kind of assistance to move to many gate changes. Again like I said they think that we are a bother to them they get paid the same. My flight to Utah was a night mare from hell. Took me about 12 hours after all the delay.I will never again take another flight with American Airline. But they don't really care.  They spend all the big bucks making the video about how good they look. Well management if you ever read reviews from customers take notes. You are doing all the wrong thing and you are losing customers fast."
"If you fly 1st class and need to change your flight they will charge a change fee and not just the difference between the flights. Most all the other airlines will not charge a change fee because of COVID and for first class or premium seating, never. Also in 1st class if they feel like serving they might, so don't expect it. Will only use when I have to."
"Is there an airline that DOESN'T suck anymore?   Almost delayed now for 4 hours 3 gate changes American Airlines , now delayed for 5 hours and 4 gate changes.  American Airlines sucks, United airlines sucks, I guess try Delta, or buy my own damn private plane."
"Team is unhappy. I can tell by rude staff, not caring approach, disrespect to the passengers."
Delays. Cancelations.  4 hours on Tarmac. No fun! Staff was wonderful though!!!   Will try to use a different airline in the future.
"If I could give zero stars I would. This is the worst airline I've ever dealt with. I flew American Airlines because I was taking my son on a college visit to Lubbock. He's being recruited by Texas Tech. We had plans for him to sit in on some meetings before and after practice. Then the coach had invited us for dinner and a baseball game. Our flight was scheduled to leave at 10:24 AM. Before takeoff the pilot announced that there were technical difficulties and the plane had to go back to the hanger. We were then delayed two, three, then four hours. Finally we were told that they could put us on a 6:30 pm flight to Dallas where we would have to layover for two hours then get on a flight to Lubbock. We would arrive in Lubbock at 11:40 PM. While waiting in line a supervisor came up to us and told us to go to another line when it was almost our turn. So then we went to a longer line that had two people helping. Then when the line gets shorter one person left. And we stood there in line for another 40 minutes. It was like pulling teeth to get them to upgrade us to better seats. Avoid American Airlines at all cost. Fly Southwest or someone else.Oh and by the way.....two planes broke down at the same time. They had to get parts from United..... unbelievable. How are these people still in business!"
