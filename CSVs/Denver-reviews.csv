This is for the Denver baggage claim When coming in from Charlotte someone took my bag. They left one that looked exactly like mine but didn't check the name tag I was on my way to a wedding and really wanted my clothes The staff was great. They called the owner of the bag that was left. After several attempts they picked up. They turned around and brought my bag back. I just barely made my shuttle Thank you to the guys in the baggage claim office for working so hard to get my bag back. You saved the day
"11/27/22 we had a return trip from Orlando to Denver with a connection flight in Miami.  In the Miami, the landing gate and departure gate were next to each other.  In Orlando, we had a delay on the tarmac, not weather related.  In Miami we also had a tarmac delay, not weather related, both cases pilots said weather was great.On Miami tarmac, having landed at 1840, we had the gate changed to E7 on the other side of airport.  We told stewardess that we had connection flight as did several other passengers, she was short, only said she would make announcement. Nobody cared, disembarkment was chaotic like always, stewardess didn't care.  We got to gate E7, even though people were still boarding they said our tickets were released.  Even though when I check in at Orlando which checked me in with Miami I (I had a boarding pass to Miami flight) they released it. They sent me to rebooking and put my family in different seats and much later time. No meal vouchers, no real apologies.  I wanted to talk to a manager.  The lady at counter said she was a manger and refused to call.  I told her I was not moving until I talk to manager. She threatened to call security and have me escorted, cancel my ticket and force me to buy a ticket with another airline.  I was traumatized, threatened and felt blackmailed.  I had no recourse, no one to complain to or with.  I was helpless, vulnerable , I felt violated.  She said delay was due to weather and weather is not in their control.  I told her AA knew I was on flight, knew flight was running late, and knew when I landed prior to boarding of new plane.  The dropped the ball, they didn't communicate nor take care of their passengers.  I did what I could to hold back my tears.  I will never fly American again. I'm still fighting for my refund of fair.  The biggest issue is they kept passing the buck, blaming someone else, yet they claim they are each managers.  It's transparently deceiving and manipulative .  I'm afraid for the next time I have to fly, the thought gives me anxiety.  I'm so mad at American Airlines, they ruined a lot for me."
"So I arrived early to check in and when I say early I mean early. The line to check in is unbelievable, no one is around and all kiosks are down. So I think no big deal, I'm already checked in, so noted when I checked in I was having issues to begin with and had booked my flight 3 days ahead of time.  So as I'm talking to the agent and she is asking for all my credentials, id, passport, confirmation number everything. She proceeds to tell me I'm sorry but you not on this flight.... I'm flying from Denver to Houston, so anyways what do mean? She told me that I had canceled my flight, I said no I didn't I have confirmation that I'm on this flight. I was being very Pleasant with them but that didn't matter basically said sorry nothing I can do. I said if there is a cancellation don't you send a confirmation they said yes, well I have it to send me a text and email.... Because that way there is no way they can't let me know changes.!So after an hour they say hey we will put you on standby, fly out later which was fine but what about my luggage? Oh it should be in Houston. Well all this hassle with them it is not with it. They over book a flight and blame the customer and we pay the price.  If in anyway I will not fly with them if it is possible. This is how it with American Airlines!!!! They're hub is here in Denver and it sucks!!! Delta is the only way to go. Well see you in Houston bags!"
"Terrible, unresponsive, and unfriendly customer service.Why choose to use American or United when Southwest and Alaska are far superior and don't nickel and dime you?They have no sense of urgency and their maintenance crews are incompetent."
"My flight was delayed initially for several hours due to a maintenance issue.  Then it was delayed several more times for several more hours because they couldn't get a flight crew.  Eventually it was delayed until the next day.  I understand delays happen, but just cancel the flight up front rather than forcing me me to stay in the airport for 9 hours only to cancel it anyway.Then I was told that I could get a hotel and American would reimburse me.  I was told it was easy to go on the website and request.  However, I can't find anything on the website related to this type of request.  I've not waited on hold a couple time for hours only to get disconnected.So I put in an email request and was told via automated message that could take up to 7 days or more to receive any sort of response.I still have not gotten this matter resolved and I will be surprised at this point if I ever will."
"I'm stuck between a 3 and 4. I absolutely hate that you're charged for WiFi when literally everything else is being charged for. Everything these days runs off of WiFi. I know it's trivial, but I feel like these days it seems everyone only cares about how much extra money they can make. Anyways! It was a short flight so there wasn't much else to say. It was a smooth flight, staff were sweet so that was a bonus."
"Crooks!!! These guys charged me for my flight, canceled same day and rescheduled it to the next. This is understandable, sure, it happens. However good luck getting a refund. Their systems request you provide a ""flight number"" when all I've received is a reservation code. Calling in to see where I can find this or be refunded my $700 ticket (not to mention they still charged me for checking bags...on a flight I didn't take) the time for a hold/callback is 11 HOURS. This company needs to be shut down by the FAA. Filing a complaint."
"This is worst airline in the world.  I haven't had an on time departure or landing this year. They treat passengers, even those of us with status, like animals. I am done.  I can never get these wasted days back.  I have also never seen a company communicate so poorly."
"First they changed my 8:30am flight to 7:05am, which means I had to wake up at 3:30am to get to the airport by 5am because of all the backups at tsa. I awoke at 3:30am to find that at 2:45am they changed my flight to 3pm then to the following day, due to 'maintenance'. I choose to cancel the outbound portion of my journey and find a flight with a different airline. Now they are telling me they can't refund me for that cancelation until I complete the non-canceled portion of my return flight. Why do they have the power to do this?"
"We were very fortunate to get a good deal on flights to Hawaii, however given we have small children and an infant, we still had to board last.  Not a big deal, but on 3 of the 4 flights the steward/stewardess were not very nice. In fact, my wife just needed to use a restroom at the very end of our flight after waiting for passengers to disembark and got yelled at that she needs to use the terminal restrooms.  With 5 small children and an infant, I was shocked to get such a rude remark, even after all 5 of our kids were silent for all 4 flights!!!  So disappointed in the customer service and lack of care by the flight attendants!"
"Worst worst worst.   7 delays totaling 7 hours to leave Denver.   So unacceptable, its beyond ridiculous....    Would not let me post if I didn't put some star on the damn thing.  But it's zero!!"
"NO. Just NO. I purchased a ticket to France from American Airlines, back in November of 2019 for $400.00 which isn't so bad. The trip was set for August of 2020. In March of 2020, Nick totally made me fall in love with him for even offering to join me on what was supposed to be my second solo travel trip. Europe was not in the best standing for a while now, given recent events and all the politics going on. My plan was to take a train to Toulouse and fly in from Charles De Guile which was cheaper. American Airlines over the phone wait time was over two hours. Their service was a disgusting nightmare. I went to their ticket counter, and dealt with a rude girl. I told the manager that I wasn't fond of the service, and they had the audacity to bring the girl I complained over to me to tell me I complained against her. Totally making things awkward. Horrible snake of a manager. I cancelled my ticket through my credit card company, which made me feel better. I cannot stand American Airlines. UNPROFESSIONAL AT BEST. I will never give you another penny of mine."
"Wow, worst experience I've had at this airport. Trying to check in, they don't use an ID anymore, and the woman who is supposed to be helping you check in was very rude and not helpful at all. I had to go up to the front desk to get actual help. They were actually pretty nice there. Then, down at my gate...what a pig sty. I suppose it's not ""their job"" to clean things up. Pretty ridiculous. Also, not related to American Airlines, but going through A gate security...wow, are those people ever obnoxious! They wantwanted me to push someone's backpack into the screening tuand when I refused, they shoved my tub so hard against that other persons backpack, that I heard a crack. Nice."
Your cattle no matter the airline no matter the pandemic  the fact that families like mine are separated because we can't pay the fees to sit together at the back of the plane. The only interest they have is signing you up for a bullshit travel credit card. If your lucky the stewardess ‍ will ask to help to remove the heavy luggage above you to reward you with a 32oz water for your troubles. Ask yourself why we fly these unfortunate unfriendly skies. At least I got free water my last flight !
"Flight 2859 Den - PhlEvery time I fly this garbage airline, they pull the 'mechanical delay"" nonsense. This time the original delay was storms in  Philadelphia and after a couple of hours it has now become the mysterious mechanical issue delaying us 5 hours more. This is more the norm than not these days. Never again if I can help it."
"I use a manual wheelchair and travel solo. Multiple times a year I take one particular trip that involves every element of a disabled passenger's least favorite flight, including a connection through a busy major airport onto a small  plane that is boarded from the tarmac. Ever since American Airlines took over USAir I have been amazed by the extra steps AA takes to make sure it's disabled customers have a trouble free experience. A representative always calls the day before the flight to go over the details of my specific situation to make sure everything goes smoothly. On a recent trip, the flight attendant discreetly (much appreciated) informed me how the crew would evacuate me in the event of an emergency. This was the first time any airline has demonstrated  that they were consciously taking my safety  and my specific situation into consideration.  Thank you, American Airlines!6/11/18 Here I am again on Flt473 Charlotte to Denver and the crew (Tyrone, Gary) introduced themselves and helped me pre-board. Totally pleasant, totally professional."

"If i could rate this airline 0 stars..i would. it's not even humanly possible to elaborate how much hatred this airline makes me feel. The flights are always delayed, the customer service on the aircraft is absolute dog shit, the flight attendants and captains don't communicate with their passengers, and even when they are the reason you miss your connecting flight, they don't even reprimand you accordingly.  ESPECIALLY AS A MILITARY MEMBER, they show no concern for the well being and accommodations of their passengers. I would rather eat a whole plane with a spoon than fly this airline again."
"A BIG FUCKING ZERO is more like itDelayed flight Missed connecting flight Rude as hell service and GUESS WHAT I let them know, This airlines is only 60% on time and have so many mechanical issues because they're planes are so old"
"American airlines sent me an email they changed my flight 4 days after I booked.  The new time didn't work for me, so I called to cancel flight. After 2.5  hours on hold, American said I can't cancell/ get refund because the change they made was less than a 4 hour change in flight time.American Airlines changed the terms of the flight contract, then refused to refund.  Never fly on American Airlines.  American Airlines is the worst Airline."
"Your decision to spit in the face of law enforcement and support domestic terrorists has officially ended my relationship with your airline. This isn't an attempt to be inclusive, this is an attempt to placate raging mobs and play  political games. I want my money back because I refuse to fly your airline ever again."
"The US taxpayers bailed out the airline industry for 25 billion dollars in 2020, despite us keeping them afloat they still inept and lack any semblance of customer service. I had my flights rescheduled for days on end until I finally gave up and demanded a refund which took days more to go through. Do NOT fly American, these shitheads will fuck everything up"
They moved me to another flight. They didn't even email me that my flight was changed to one 4 hours later. Then that flight was delayed for 2 hours. Ruined our whole day of vacation and cost an extra 100 plus dollars to return the rental car later. The customer service representative was very rude and didn't apologize once. I hope he gets fired. Also the crew never passed out in flight snacks like they promised or apologized for the delay.
"Checked in with the kiosk and got my boarding pass; was unsure if I would have to check a bag or not but decided to wait in line. Was approached by a worker without prompting that said I would have to check my bag and that it would be $30; I said that I didn't have to pay anything on my flight down - also with American Airlines. The same woman employee was talking to about 3-4 other people while still trying to talk with me; which is not only rude but illogical; still she continued arguing with me to the point where I just shut her rudeness off and ignored her.  I continued to wait in line, and as I approached the counter where the boarding pass is viewed and looked at - the female employee comes from behind and chimes in. I explained that I didn't want to speak with her or be around her because she doesn't know the situation and was not approached in the first place and is beginning to harass me.This was immediately doubted by the female employee I was now speaking with and I explained that I was told I would have to pay $30 for a checked bag but didn't have to pay anything on the way down. She argued with me a bit and then kept talking over me, then flipped it around and stated that I was talking over her! I was flabbergasted because that's not what the case was at all. I then repeated the following, ""Can I ask a question"". All the while I was being talked over and then finally I was granted a pause to ask my question. My question was why wasn't I charged on the way down and why am I being charged now. I got zero feedback. I said this was fucking bullshit and not proper, and then because I swore my boarding pass was immediately ripped up. I was then threatened with having security and cops called on me if I didn't step away.Now Denver, Colorado has one of the highest populations of homeless persons; and here was a woman not only abusing her authority with zero empathy; but also effectively leaving me homeless with zero resources and with a zero refund or ability to get back home ( all the way in PA).  She didn't seem to care or relent and continued to make threats of calling security and cops on me; an U.S. Army Combat Veteran and a minority to her blatant abuse of authority. She didn't care that I didn't have friends or family in the area, financial means, or resources and she continued to threaten my quality of life and freedom over a $30 dollar charge that I didn't have to pay on the way down.   I was then told by another worker that I would have to call the hotline, and I did. Firstly, I was on hold for over 45 minutes before being disconnected; but first I heard a voice on the end before the call ends. I called again and wait about 35 minutes before I again hear a voice and then I'm disconnected before I can reply.   Then I managed to stay on hold and I selected the option to receive a call back at my cell number and I'm told that I have to wait for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hrs.  I get a call eventually within that period, but I received no justice or a reasonable solution.I ended up having to contact various friends and finally got lent $400 for another ticket, money that I didn't have and money that now although has been paid off, has left me struggling even more without it.This was nothing but an abuse of power by the female manager, especially since both females and men employees with the airline offered to help only to deny me when I made my way back through the line again. Since she was the manager and already filed additional steps; it was unable to be reversed.  I was so angry, sad, frustrated, and flabbergasted at the actions of this female manager. She completely overreacted and didn't even reflect on the consequences of her leaving me without my ticket back.   She just abused her authority and was happy about it. She couldn't give me a reasonable excuse as to why I was being charged and where I previously was not and she didn't care. She talked over me and didn't care about the customer. This woman should seriously have an inquiry/investigation be opened on her because she behaved like a prepubescent child that was placed in charge for the first time and let it go to her head.  She didn't care that I would have to either be homeless or somehow find a way home.American Airlines has not offered any means of reimbursement for the flight lost or for the flight that I had to pay. This is how you get treated when you serve this Nation.  The thing was I offered to pay the erroneous charge that they first provided complimentarily but was denied, despite me stating the situation they were effectively placing me in.  Also on the way down, where the complimentary service was provided. An AA employee made fun of my duffel bag because it was beaten up and torn. I am not a man that is rich, I can't afford the best clothes and items and I took this insult ( passed off as a joke) very seriously but kept my mouth shut.  I don't understand why these airline employees act like this!. Shame on You"
"Once again American Airlines has let down a very Loyal customer (maybe I am to blame for being loyal). We are leaving Denver and we are delayed once again. (Btw this is my 7th flight in the last 6 weeks). Not only was I treated poorly by the Denver American Airlines team, we paid for an upgrade they did not honor. My caution to everyone is don't pay for the extras because they take our$$$$, but give us half of the service they did pre-Covid. They are using Covid as an excuse to be bad at what they do... once again I have flown over 1.6MM miles, so I am not an amateur with flying on American. They can, and have done better...."
"Flying american airlines today, 12/22.  Every seat is booked, 0 social distancing, and 90% of the people have cloth or bandana masks which have been proved ineffective.  If they worked just as well my hospital would require a legit mask meant for droplet precautions.  It's really quite side, the pandemic has been going on for months now.  Good luck to the people with lowered immune systems.  Won't fly American Airlines again."
"We were trying to check in to our flight but  missed our connecting flight, because customs had an enormous line. Melissa at American Airlines was a rude unhelpful snarky b****. She did absolutely nothing to help us in our already stressful situation. She made sarcastic and undermining comments to make us out like we were stupid. I think that someone representing an airline should have better customer service skills and maybe try and be kind & help customers who PAY for their services."
"Worst airline ever. The lost my bags for an entire week while I was traveling to Texas with my wife to say good bye to get dad and take him off of life support. Every time I called them I got a different story until finally a few days after I got home I was told that they were at my home airport but had been marked as do not deliver despite me providing my address for delivery 3 or 4 times. They didn't give me any vouchers or compensation for the entire fuck up. I did get a voucher for changing my flight to a cheaper one, but after hours of phone calls and messages to their customer service people I STILL CANT USE IT because the links don't work. Now I'm being told that it was mailed but reissued as an evoucher which makes no sense because I got emails in the first place and no one but the person their chat disconnected me from seemed to know anything about mailed vouchers. DONT EVER FLY WITH THESE PEOPLE"
"They are awful. This is the first bad yell review I've ever left. Our flight was delayed and they couldn't get us out until 330 the next day and to add insult to injury they were so incredibly rude about it, and acted like it was such an inconvenience to look for earlier flights out. If you can use another airline do it"
Absolutely the worst. Can not get passengers in control or seated. Stewards in sure of how to do emergency announcement   No video available. Low cost Frontier is looking better all the time. Flight was delayed for no real reason. People no sitting in assigned seats. Absolutely tis sucks.    Learn what costumer service is and how to control your passengers. Parents book your kids seats with your own. And take care of your own issues. Because of the poor performance by the flight crew I am thinking this flight needs to be reported to the FAA.During landing the woman gets up to pass a small child back to its mother. While the stewardesses watched. Ho fucking unsafe for the child and me. Found out the mother and her husband should have been seated 14 rows ahead of me why were they in my and my companions seat.   WTF does this airline do about safety and assuring the flight is safe and orderly.
Thank you Ivan at gate A53 with flight 1067 at 6:10 am for being extremely rude during my bag checking experience. He chastised me for having a personal item (LOL) when he literally could've just let me pay to check my bag and be on my way. I've never had such a negative and RUDE experience with American and I fly with them at least twice a month.
"We were excited to finally fly to see my brother at his new Air Force base when sadly my 75 year old father fell and broke his arm.  We are now not able to fly and needed to cancel our reservations.  We always preferred to fly American Airlines because of their great customer service, when I called to ask for a refund I was directed to then"" supervisor "" who told me there is nothing he can do.  No one has authority to offer anything but a credit.  I don't know when they will be allowed to fly again.  I guess since covid... customer services is dead.   Also  when getting off the phone with me he in a derogatory tone said .. God bless you.   Excuses me!!!!  Thank you American Airlines.  Will not pay extra to fly with you again!"
"Let's save some time and cross off two items of my to-do list-at the same time.  Write both a review and a Dear John letter.  The lucky recipient? American Airlines.N-E-V-E-R Again.  Flying out to Denver for Father's Day on Friday night from Phoenix.  I took off from work early to get into Denver in time for reservations at a fantastic farm-to-table restaurant in Boulder (Black Cat).  Flight was delayed one hour, thirty-seven minutes.  AA cost me time away from work- yes I'm salaried but I have responsibilities and work to accomplish not to mention you cost me incredibly valuable time with my daughter who I haven't seen in over a year.  I TRUSTED you to do your job and get me to Denver on-time. Fail.  But I decided to show you as much grace as I could, you never know why things happen so I swallowed hard, took the loss, and endured the middle seat madness to Denver.  Amazing weekend with my daughter, explored, ate, and laughed all the time. She generously took me up the hill to Estes Park prior to me leaving Sunday afternoon at 6:05.  I want to do my part so I get the airport on-time, navigate myself through the sh*t-show that is DIA check-in and get through security only to discover the flight was delayed two hours.  In fact as I arrived at the gate, they were announcing that the incoming flight from Phoenix was just leaving Phoenix.  SMH.FAIL X2.  Four hours of my life I'll never get back- time lost with family on both ends.When you say at the end of our flights, ""Thank you for flying American, we know you have many choices"" you need to start believing it.  I'm done, I'll look at this review every time I'm tempted to book another flight on your airline.I know you're desensitized to letters like this and that's a shame.  While you're a public company, you also fly with the permission of the FAA and I hope they start coming down hard on you which hurts your financial shareholders which in turn finally starts the wheels of change at the executive and management level.  However, as for me. . . Done, goodbye, never again."
Straight garbage...I have flown out of Denver for the last 8 consecutive weeks and been delayed 30+ minutes on 6 of those flights. Bush league operation these days. Do yourself a favor and fly anyone else but AA.
Trash. Delayed flight. Going to miss connecting flight. No other flights out for two days. Delay first started because of a kissing log book. Plane was at the gate hours before scheduled departure but... who actually bothers to check for anything until the passengers are all on the flight. Have to deplane so to a maintenance issue. Finally get us all back on the plane four hours later. Get to runway. Same maintenance issue occurs. We have to go BACK to the gate. The plane was sitting at the gate for hours before the original departure time but they couldn't run the maintenance check until it was time to leave? Ridiculous. I fly at least once a month and I have never had everything go smoothly with American Airlines.
