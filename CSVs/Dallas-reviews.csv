"My experience at American Airlines was nothing short of a nightmare. From the moment I stepped foot into the Dallas headquarters, I felt like an outsider in my own country. My background, culture, beliefs, and ethnicity were not welcomed there. The lack of diversity and equal opportunities was evident, and it was clear that only certain ethnicities were allowed to thrive.The discrimination didn't stop there. My manager forced me to go to the Dallas headquarters for a team activity, but refused to reimburse me for the expenses. I had to pay for the entire business trip, including hotel, food, gas, etc. out of my own salary. This was not only unacceptable, but it also put a significant financial burden on me.The mistreatment continued when my work computer started having VPN and network issues. I reached out to IT for help, but instead of assistance, I was flagged for ""inappropriate use of the internet"" with no explanation. I discovered that IT had access to my bookmarks and personal information through my work computer. They even made me access a gaming site in order to unblock my IP, making me feel like a joke.To add insult to injury, IT told me that they couldn't help me because I was a contractor and not a full-time employee. They suggested that I constantly switch proxies. This made it impossible for me to do my job, and my manager did nothing to help me.I was eventually fired for ""poor performance"" without any notice, but it was clear that this was a retaliation for speaking out against the discrimination and mistreatment I faced.I want to make it clear that discrimination has no place in any workplace, and it's unacceptable for a company as large as American Airlines to treat its employees in such a manner. I urge the management at AA to take a hard look at their hiring and management practices and make a change for the betterment of all employees."
"I was discriminated as my background, culture, beliefs, & ethnicity are not welcomed at American Airlines. Non equal opportunity, & ethnical bias is evident. AA is not a diverse place. Seems like only certain ethnicities can thrive there.My manager said that I had to go to the AA Dallas headquarters for a week due to a team activity. However, my AA manager did not allow me to expense the business trip... I had to PAY FOR THE ENTIRE BUSINESS TRIP WITH MY OWN SALARY . No free flights. I payed for hotel, food, gas, etc. I went anyways as it was was non-optional. I spent my entire week's salary to pay for that business trip.Entry leve & contractors are micromanaged & spied through their work computers. When my work computer started having VPN & network issues, I reached out to IT, they told me that they flagged my computer's IP for ""inappropriate use of the internet"", although, I solely used the computer for work. There was no explanation on why my computer had an ""internet disciplinary behavior infraction"".I found out that AA IT had access to my bookmarks & personal private information through my work computer.1 of the IT employees oddly told me through the phone to access a gaming site (Battle.net), which was deep into my bookmarks' folders, in order to get authenticated & temporarily unblock my IP. I had to access that site every time. I felt like they were laughing at my face.IT said that they can't help me because I was a contractor & not a full-time. They told me that I needed to constantly switch proxies.Everything went well the first 8 weeks. I successfully completed multiple project. However, mysteriously after 8 weeks, my VPN stopped working. The computer's IP address & proxy were blocked. It took me hours to connect every single day, & then it was randomly unblocked.I couldn't work for the first few hours of the day as everything on my work computer was unaccessible/unauthorized, except for calls with my team. Most of the relevant internet's sites were restricted/blocked.I have evidence to believe that my manager removed my access to the VPN. I wouldn't be surprised to find out there was corruption & collusion going on internally at AA in order to kick out people that ""din't belong"" due to their ethnicity & views/perspectives. My computer wasn't able to connect to the AA Dallas headquarters network.I asked my manager if they could give me another computer, she refused. I felt forced to work on my personal computer, & was very uncomfortable, I felt like I had no privacy. Working on my personal computer didn't solve the issue but allowed me to connect to the VPN more often.I couldn't get much work done. Everyone on my team said that they didn't know what the problem was. My manager told me to not worry about it & give it some time.Weeks later, I got fired for 'poor performance' without any notice.When I first came to AA Dallas headquarters, the front desk woman asked me for my batch, I didn't have one. She then asked me for my ID & wallet. I was relatively new so I was scared to refuse, she emptied my wallet on the table & said ""none of these IDs work.My manager came 2h later to let me in. Once I got in, my manager did not even introduce me nor showed me around, she left me in the first floor with IT (which is not my field).I ended up touring myself around, & on the last floor, I was interrogated by a white haired man about many things such as why I was walking around on my own, my employee ID, & where was my manager -- I told him that I was getting to know the workspace as it was my first day at the AA office. it made me feel like a criminal.The discrimination I faced at AA didn't stop me from success. Months after being fired, I got a job at a FAANG as a software engineer. None of the AA problems happened there. My current job has been amazing for the past year, full of inclusion, diversity, non-bias, & leadership.Everyone should be treated equally & with respect, & have access to equal opportunities. All I want is for AA to stop discriminating its 'different' employees."
"If I could give this airline a zero or a negative star I would. They jerked our chain for 3 hours. Continually delaying our flights. This is so ridiculous! Changed our gates seven times, delayed our flights two and a half hours only to be treated by snide remarks from the gate representative! We are treated like sh*t while management and admin get rich off the people having to fly for the holidays. You people should be ashamed of yourselves and how you treat you customers.Hey American now you load the plane and leave the passengers without air on the tarmac with a lame excuse about baggage. Hey can you turn on the air conditioner so we don't fry back here. Amazing no flight attendant poked their heads out to check on the passengers. Oh that's right, you don't care! What is wrong with this organization. Here it is, they got your money, they don't care. We are on the tarmac now, flight 696 after a three hour delay, letting us burn up in our seats from the lack of air. Why do you treat us like cattle, why do you despise your customers, why do you lack customers service, why are you in this business. I'm sure the CEO and the C-Suite are home and ignoring everything that's going on. Seriously, the name should be American Worst Airlines.Saga continues. So we finally land at lax but they need to tow us to the gate. Once again we sit on the tarmac. This is like the twilight zone. This airlines don't want their passengers to leave the plane, seriously! We've been in the air for three hours after a three hour delay and we are at a gate that needs to be towed. Who manages this mess! This aircraft should've had special services. Again ridiculous!"
"7:15am flight out of E9 FLL stated ""on time"", while directly next to that sign it said ""now boarding"" for New Haven E9. Apparently their flight had been delayed. The plane was boarding, I heard calls for LA, PR and that is all. As the crowd died down, j went to see if my flight was delayed too since they can't board to planes out of the same gate. This is when I found out they boarded my flight already. The people that were standing around were all confused since it said Boarding New Haven. The rest of us got on the plane and many were asking for clarification.  We sat ready to take off when the pilot announced we would be returning to the gate to fuel. Not sure how we got out there ready for take off without fuel in the first place. So we head in, the fuel was being placed and then the pilot said it will take longer because the plane needs ""8000 gallons"". Then the pilot came back on the pilot shaded there is a storm in the gulf that we will fly under at a lower altitude. As we waited the AC was turned off and we just sat for a while. After waiting for an hour an a half the pilot shared not on the mic that he wasn't going to fly around the storm and then he picked up his bags and left. Now we were told we needed to deplane and see if they could ""find a pilot"" and ""if"" they could the plane would still fly to DFW. As we waited the hours went by. The employees had zero information and I am sure they would have loved to know what was going on too. They shared that they are still seeing if a pilot would respond to the call. So that means a total of 11 hours waiting with delays sent by text every 30 minutes so We couldn't leave the gate basically. Finally a pilot showed and he announced he is confident he could make it through the storm and get us to DFW, however FAA now is not allowing the plane to leave. We did see other flights taking off, however yes they were going to different locations. Talk about a longggggggggg day. Everyone around me shared this is normal for American Airlines. I hadn't flown American in years. I will think twice. I'm sitting here for the flight home. I hope the experience improves. I had paid $60 extra for the flight to DFW for priority seating which they didn't follow and for the main cabin better seating. People were sitting in the first class seats where people had left and moving their seats for free. While I sat with already dishing out the $30 extra 2X making it $60. I asked this morning for my flight coming home if i could have complimentary priority loading and I was told nothing is complimentary on American and that I would need to pay. I even had explained quickly my experience. It did not matter."
I love American Airlines! Great snacks and cookies! And free movies on ur phone! Love it!!
"We flew Business Class for the first time - and the upgrade was worth every penny. The food was fantastic and the flight attendant friendly, smooth flight too + we got into Mexico early!"
"Let's face it none of us flies domestically because of the food served on an airline.on a flight from Philadelphia to San Diego of just over five hours I thought I would have the dinner selection of some kind of pasta with a salad and a roll. The flight attendants were spectacular. The food served were somewhat less than spectacular. The flight was uneventful, other than no bourbon on board."
"love American Airlines.  They fly everywhere I need to go and have good legroom on their planes. It's nice getting updates in flight statuses from the airline via text, staying ahead of the gate, should there be any changes.I've found employees to be fine. None of them have been rude to me.  At the airport the employees clearly have a lot on their plates, and in the air, my flight attendants have been courteous. I've even scored those ever so delicious cookies on flights they weren't distributed (hint: it just means there's not enough--ping a flight attendant and ask QUIETLY for some)."
"I've flown American for many years. I hold 2 Million Miler status and Platinum for life, so I've seen the various ups and downs of this business. After a less than pleasant B737 flight today from EWR to DFW I decided they deserve a wake-up review. As with most airlines,  they go through periods of investment, followed by years of milking the operation, including the staff. It's sadly obvious American is in a milking phase. Incidentally milking cycles follow CEO level staff directives who get rewarded by profits, which happens when no investments occur during these downward quality and upward profit periods. It's a much bigger corporate problem, but I will not digress...Some of their equipment has become aged as the case today, mind you I am sure all of their aircraft are safe and maintained to rigid FAA standards. Warn rugs and seats were evident in the Plane and EWR Admirals Club,  and a general lack of smiles, or outright frowns by some crew members, albeit not all. I used the B737 front lav today (business/first) and was appalled by the filth which has obviously been in place for weeks, if not months. See pic showing significant dirt around the air vent, as well as dried yellow matter around the bottom/front of the seat. A bit of care, cleaner, and elbow grease is all that would be needed to address this. Keep in mind, this is the lav the crew uses, so it's not like cabin staff doesn't see it!!I gave 2 stars because of the many great employees. In fact on the flight home on a much later Airbus A321 (non-American made), the staff was much more pleasant and the aircraft much cleaner. Please American, do the right thing for an Airline with such great American heritage!"
Grrr. There was an issue with my seat and the lady at the counter was entirely unhelpful. I was standing there politely and waited for her to acknowledge me which she did not. She did however have time to talk to her colleagues and flight staff in a relaxed manner. When I finally went up to her and explained what I needed...she could not resolve it and seemed nonchalant about it. I know she is not representative of the entire staff but this was my experience and I am rating it based on that.
"We don't blame them for the weather that caused the delay in our first flight, but every issue we have had since has been caused by American Airlines failures. Not to mention the poor customer service. I know everyone is frustrated, but I have not heard one harsh tone from a single customer. The American Airlines representatives, however, have been short tempered and clearly annoyed with everyone they are coming into contact with, even before the customer speaks. I have been flying regularly for personal and business reasons for years. I ALWAYS have trouble when flying with American Airlines. They have ruined the first TWO days of our vacation with their constant failures and will do NOTHING to make it right.And they still have no idea where our luggage is located. Completely worthless.I hope they go under."
Excellent flight crew and pretty smooth flight. One minor  delay before take-off just a few minutes.Considering the flight was full and I do mean full. The flight crew was excellent.
"I've been lucky enough to travel these past few years, and 99% of the trips have been with American Airlines. Why? Because their tickets prices have been the best deals.For my latest trip it started with a gate change and one hour delay. That became another gate change, then another with the departure time getting later and later. The gates were far apart with no notification of changing gates until the last few minutes you see all these people getting out if their seats, and running to another gate. Only at that time, if you happen to look at the monitor will you see the notice. What happened to the text messaging I signed up for? How about something over the loud speaker.I don't know about you, but a lot of times I wander around the terminal looking in the shops or eating and/or drinking somewhere. I HATE to just sit by the gate and wait and wait. Once you get on the plane you can tell right away they are old and dirty and the seats! The seats are so close together you're almost sitting on top of the next person. I guess it's ok if you know the person, but what about strangers and their annoying habits or hygiene? I know it's not just American that the seats space has shrunk.Bottom self is what I would call their customer service both inside the plane and outside.This last trip was awful with so many delays there was no food available on the plane, and when we landed at the airport for a connecting flight home, our flight was so delayed all the restaurants and stores were closed. I didn't even see a vending machine for snacks. However I did see a vending machine for makeup..so weird.Delay delay delay by the time we got to our final airport destination it was like a ghost town. Standing at the baggage carousel watching for our luggage, the carousel just kept going around and around with no luggage for us or for about half of the people on our flight. We realized after the carousel stopped, there was no more luggage coming out, we had to walk over to baggage claim, which was not close by. One lonely guy trying to help all these people, and to top it off there were no taxi's available at this ungodly hour. He said ""I'll have to call and order one."" While we were waiting for a yellow taxi, I downloaded the uber app on my phone and the uber got there before a taxi did. So yes we took the uber and cancelled the taxi.Our luggage thankfully arrived the next day. Moral of the travel story with American...you get what you pay for."
"Comparing my experiences flying domestically with American Airlines to US-based airlines of similar size, Delta and United, American is easily last. Hence, my two-star rating which equates to what Yelp describes as, ""Could've been better.""Most notably, American trails behind Delta and United in terms of aircraft cabins, comfort, and amenities + customer service. Simply put, in recent years, Delta and United's planes have nicer, more upgraded and modern interiors. American's planes, while not bad, have felt a step behind. I'm talking about everything, from the comfort of the seats to the overhead lighting and overall interior design aesthetics. Generally, American's cabins are currently outdated in comparison.As far as in-flight entertainment and food in coach, I think American, Delta, and United are about the same: OK. Each airline has their own licensed set of movies, TV shows, music, etc. Good content can be found on each airline. This is anecdotal, but I've been on a higher percentage of American flights that don't have screens for in-flight entertainment. Instead, I had to use my own device to watch movies/TV, after connecting to the plane's Wi-Fi. In general, the food across all three airlines has been unremarkable - but again, not bad.In terms of customer service, my experiences with American have been the worst when compared to Delta and United. My wife and I have always been able to sit next to each other on Delta and United flights. If we get our boarding passes and see that we aren't sitting next to each other, we go to the gate agent and the agent seats us next to each other, no problem. For whatever reason (company policy?), that hasn't been the case with American. While not a big deal, it's just another example of why American trails behind their competitors.Also, within the past year, I booked a trip with American Airlines, months in advance through the Bank of America Travel Center (Travel Rewards). The trip was from North Carolina to Hawaii. American changed our itinerary several times leading up to our actual final flights. Bank of America Travel Center notified me each time American changed our itinerary. Each time, I had to confirm and accept the itinerary changes. No problem there. What was a problem was - as an American Airlines agent explained to me over the phone - that while both American and Bank of America knew about my itinerary changes, new final tickets were never actually issued.Because new tickets were never issued, both our initial outbound and initial inbound flights were affected. Outbound, my wife and I weren't able to check in, get our boarding passes, and see our seat assignments using the American Airlines app. I had to call American to get the issue resolved. Inbound, my wife and I had the same problem, except it was with the Hawaiian Airlines app (our initial inbound flight was on a Hawaiian Airlines flight that was codeshared with American). So, we had to check-in at the Hawaiian Airlines counter at the airport in Hawaii the old-fashioned way. Again, while not a big deal, these were inconveniences we experienced with American that we've never encountered with Delta or United. It was unnecessary extra time spent on our part.At the end of the day, it's not that I don't like American Airlines. I have no issues flying American again if it makes sense. However, I prefer Delta and United because both of those airlines are better than American all around.American, Delta, and United are the largest airlines in North America by passengers carried. Southwest is up there too, but unlike the ""Big Three,"" Southwest is a low-cost / budget airline. So, comparing Southwest against the Big Three would be unfair."
We headed out to Florida last Friday and returned home today on Flight AA 1390. One of the most efficient ~ friendly ~ personable crew we've had in a while.Had to take a moment to really give a shout out to the entire crew!
"Really sad that this company has a lot of good people working for it, but it's policies from leadership are NOT CLIENT CENTRIC at all!  They obviously forgot that not too many years ago their stock dropped to a penny stock, and our government helped bail them out financially.  This company goes to all-time lows to avoid refunding clients' money who did not get what they paid for.  You pay them to fly you to a destination, but instead they take you to another state involuntarily due to their problems, and said the ticket was ""used"" so no refund is warranted.  My lawyer agreed with me, and problem solved.  Again, sad to see a big company like AA bully their customers, and somehow think it's the right thing to do.  Maybe they have young/stupid leadership who doesn't understand short term gain, but long term bigger loss."
5 Star customer service the checkin lady was really nice and help with a seating change I have never had a problem with AA airlines. Always great customer service
"Another excellent flight on American Airlines!  This trip was from DFW to SFO and the crew on the plane were helpful and provided great service.  The flight was smooth and even though we left 1 minute late, we arrived 19 minutes early.I looked at many reviews on Yelp about this and all the other popular airlines and they all had mostly negative reviews posted... No one else has had a positive experience?  Makes all the negative complaints not seem credible. Anyway - AA has my vote for always doing what's right!"
"I give one star because it's the worst I can.  This is by far the worst airline I have experienced in recent history and given I've flown both Spirit and Frontier that puts them in rarified air. We have flown roughly 16 times this quarter without incident, if possible first class.  United, Southwest, Delta, and the above mentioned and experienced any issue with only one carrier American .  Our morning flight out of Cabo was delayed 45 minutes, the online checking platform was down and upon desk checkin the agent failed to assign seats together even with full price first class tickets.  We were however heading home to Vegas through DFW Americans hub so we had to believe service would get better right? No silly our connecting flight shows a 3 hour delay but ... it gets better, as they announce boarding is about to start the follow it 30 seconds later with an announcement that the flight is cancelled.  The flight was cancelled because they didn't have crew at their own hub and proceeded to ask folks to line up at gate 24 and join what appears to be at least three other flights trying to get helped at midnight on Friday night.Stay tuned it's 1am with no solution for any at American's central hub in Dallas Fort Worth, needless to say you should look elsewhere for your travel needs.Chad"
"My go-to airline for years. I use their credit card for travel expenses and love their rewards program. I have never had a flight bumped with AA, nor had luggage list or way laid. I encounter pleasant, customer oriented employees during my travels."
I arrive at DFW at 12:30 and checked a bag at the ticket counter.  My flight boarded at 3:50.  My bag did not make it on the flight.  There is no excuse for that!
"The age old story of it was faster to drive home than fly back.Our original flight back had been delayed to later on in the evening. Fine, whatever. Only to be cancelled completely later on for a flight on the following day. Opting to rent a car to drive back seemed like a better alternative than waiting around another day. So, that's what we did.All the while, we continued to receive text updates about the flights throughout our road trip home. After I had called TWICE to confirm that our AA trip was indeed, cancelled. On our trek home, it came to light that the rescheduled flight had been delayed and cancelled yet AGAIN for the following day. We were suppose to leave on Sunday and wouldn't hVe gotten home until Tuesday had we stuck with AA.The icing on the cake was when we called today to retrieve reimbursement for our flights, since the website was reaching error every time we attempted to do so online. What a surprise at this point, amiright? Having explained the situation to our customer service rep, they had instructed us to do exactly the same thing that wasn't working online. When we explained that we had already tried that, but we'd do it again with the customer service rep on the line, their response was:""I have other calls to take"".They wanted us off the phone. Didn't want to help us. And, only escalated the situation further. Between the extensive flight cancellations and poor management,  shout-out to Pat from AA Customer Service for sealing the deal on never flying American ever again. If I could give zero stars, I would."
"I was trying to get an earlier flight back home in order to spend a few more hours with my family, as that's important to me.  I was placed on standby for an earlier AA flight here in Dallas, and when I arrived to the ticket counter when they were calling I believe Group 2 to board, the attendant told me they had plenty of space, printed out a ticket and I had a great flight home, arriving a few hours earlier than originally planned.The only criticism was that when I went to sit down, I noticed splashes of what looked like sticky soda all over the seat and the seatback in front.  Luckily the lavatory and flight attendant station were very close and one of the staff was able to wet some napkins and wipe down the seat which helped, and I used a wet-nap I was given when boarding to finish it off, but evidently that muck hadn't been caught and cleaned by the staff who supposedly clean, restock and sanitize between flights."
"I had a recent flight from DFW to Honolulu, Hawaii aboard a beautiful Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The plane was so nice! Spacious (as much as a plane can be!) and very clean. The flight attendants were all very nice and attentive. I wasn't sure if food would be served so we had purchased some food from near the gate before we boarded. We were pleasantly surprised that basic earphones were provided to everyone that wanted them. After beverages were distributed then meals were delivered and you had a choice of a chicken wrap or a vegetarian selection. I chose the chicken and it was just alright. I really liked the healthy crispy green bean veggie snack and the chocolate dessert bar. There was a great selection of movies to watch and I really enjoyed the movie Coda. I turned on subtitles because sometimes it was a little hard to hear the movie with all the surrounding noise going on. Later during the flight little bags of pretzels were given. Even though the flight was over 7 hours long, it seemed to go really fast because they were always handing out something- beverages, food, snacks, etc. and I watched several movies and before I knew it, we were in Hawaii! The return flight was an overnight flight and wasn't quite as pleasant. It was not due to the airlines though, it was just some weird, rude passengers that I happened to be sitting by. The older man behind me would cough or yawn really loud (and not covering his mouth at all) and just as I seemed to be nodding off and it made me jump several times. We landed at 6:00 am and then there was an announcement over the PA. We found out that there was an honor guard from one of the branches of the military escorting remains of someone that were recently discovered from the Korean War. They were going to the DFW National Cemetery for burial. They asked everyone to remain in their seats while the honor guard took care of what he needed to do. We could see men with flags on the ground. It was so nice that everyone stayed in their seats and were respectful as the guard exited the plane to a round of applause. It only took about 15 minutes before everyone could get up and go about their day. It was a very touching way to start the Memorial Day weekend and I was so proud to be an American at that moment."
"Incompetent bumpkins. As a general rule they are upity, unfriendly and entirely not helpful.  I have flown well over 1 million miles on American and have experienced its decline. The Dallas on the ground crew are not the worst, that donkey's butt trophy goes to Philadelphia. They are however going for it and putting on a strong negative showing. All that's missing is baggage handlers drop kicking luggage."
"Had a decent flight once finally boarded, as we had a delay due to the flight crew needing to be off for a certain amount of time due to regulations, which is ok , but the airlines should have adjusted the time for this and communicated earlier, missed connecting flight.Bright spot however was the lone agent who helped all with re booking, he really kept a positive attitude, which took the sting out of the issues."
"The most inefficient company I've seen in a long time. You know people going to Hawaii need a bracelet to bypass a line in Hawaii why do you have hardly anyone working that issue? I traveled before and they had ONE person working and it went smooth and no issues. Been in line since I departed for over 45 minutes now. Wasted my time told to go check-in on plane. You claim to offer a service to help your customers. Way to screw over your passengers to save a buck. Now will have to wait to do same process in Hawaii. On top of that you don't have a meal going into Hawaii (again to save a buck). Don't give me the garbage it's to lower the cost of your flight as we got a meal flying out of Hawaii. If I wanted to be treated like garbage and pay a fortune for bags, snack, etc. I'd fly a cheaper airline. You disappoint me. I'll be flying Alaskan next time."
"One star for getting us here safely but I will never fly American Airlines again!  Worst experience ever.  Total disregard for my husband and I and terrible customer relations.  We are now stuck in Dallas overnight with no luggage, trying to get home to Georgia.    Delay after delay.  Lost our tickets in the system and could care less. American Airlines are a disgrace."
Worse than Biden! If I could give them 0 stars I would. Won't be flying again . Thanks
"It zero stars was an option I'd go with that. Two hour + delays, get on the plane and still more maintenance issues. Don't understand what the pint is to have us sit in the plane for another hour. Never flying American again."
"Been flying AA for over 30 years, all good up until recently! The month is August and the year is 2022. AA does not have enough Pilots! Multiple flights were cancelled with No Reason given! AA passenger left stranded in the cities where they're abandoned before the last leg to destination; scrambled for a hotel to spend the night and pay out of our own pocket! The rebooked (by AA) flight was not available until the 7:00pm the next day (hotel checked out was 12 noon). That flight did not leave DFW until 11:15pm (4+ hours sat on the plane) due to AA inability to communicate w/ it's pilots!!!The plan for the future is using up AA miles and flight w/ any and all airlines."
"February 23, 2022 gate A16. Time 9am to 10:30 pm. Both female crew members working front counter at this gate are so rude, disgusting and should be fired. I did not get names of anyone as I am trying to forget the nightmares they have cause. First of all, they should have no contact with customers what so ever. It is a disgrace how they speak to everyone. Not so much the experience I had with the 13 hour delay of the flight but the lack of any skill to be kind and understanding to our frustration. It is a shame to AA that they allow this type of employees to work. I will never ever use AA for this reason. I also heard 100 other passengers share the same feeling. I hope they are given the training they need if they continue to deal with customers. Crying shame"
"20 people in line and the only one customer service person walks away. Get a clue. Get staffed. Do better. This on top of my 3hr delayed flight, missing my next flight,  rebooked with a SEVEN HOUR LAYOVER IN DFW.  I'm in line to see if i can get home earlier than 6pm. Mom had a heart attack and is going into SURGERY today. I can understand AA has no control over maintenance issues, but WHERE IS ALL THE HELP AT? No one here........."
"Hopefully leader ship at American Airlines will read this and actually take action. I arrived on a flight from Sarasota to Dallas arriving the sea terminal actually on time and in-flight service was delightful. However that's where things broke down. Having checked an oversize bag in Sarasota my bags arrived at two different package carousels which is understandable. However the oversize bag arrived at the carousel and I was there for over a half hour until an American Airlines representative finally showed up. She said she was busy and was taking care of some ""other"" things. Literally leaving the oversized desk empty for a half hour. I inquired about her name and she refused to give it to me. However who's ever working baggage carousel C4 at the six to seven p.m. hour is your employee that is absolutely horrible .One additional point, I walked to the priority gate check in to see if they could inquire and said help and literally there were eight agents doing nothing and they directed me to walk down to a different carousel and ask for them to call somebody. Seems like a big breakdown and customer serviceIf I could give zero stars I would do that"
"My flight was delayed several times then completely canceled, yet my complaint is not about the cancelation but how American Airlines staff handled it. Rather how their staff didn't handle.When we were taken off the original flight due to some kind of mechanical issue, we were not told what to do or where to go. We received a text message with a new gate, which was the only communication. Once at the new gate we were told a new aircraft was ready and they were getting a crew. We watched the crew board the new aircraft then the pilot stepped off. That was when we were informed the pilot had ""timed out"" and our flight was canceled completely. It seems American Airlines staff's compassion and customer service timed out as well.Everyone lined up to ask for help rebooking and I overheard conversations where American Airlines staff yelled at and berated customers. We asked for our checked bags; they said no. Even when people shared they had medication and baby formula in their checked bags, American Airlines staff took this stressful time to point out they shouldn't have checked important items like those. When asking about new flights, they wouldn't provide options, people were trying to figure out on their own what flights and connections they could get.When my time came to speak with American Airlines staff I shared that I didn't know what to do. The staff member looked at me with apathy and said nothing! I asked when another flight to Milwaukee would be, she said she didn't know. I asked for my checked bag and was never told if or where I could pick it up. I said if they could not help me, could I be compensated to book a flight elsewhere; I was directed to American Airlines' very unhelpful website. I was warned never to fly American Airlines and I now see why. American Airlines and their staff should be ashamed of themselves."
