"I've had mixed experiences with the staff of American Airlines. Most of the staff on my flight to Charlotte were actually friendly. I was taking a connection to Barcelona, and we were running late due to weather. An senior flight attendant kept me informed about procedures and told me all about who makes the decision on a connecting plane to wait for the late passengers or not. It's not the gate or front desk staff, or the pilot, it's all done by Dallas based upon various factors, such as how much sleep the pilots will need at the destination before they get to fly again. This flight to Charlotte was uneventful, but the pilot hardly took off the fasten seat belt sign."
What can I say about American Airlines terminal out of Ft. Lauderdale. The positive news of my interactions for this flight at least they didn't take my carry on. That's the biggest fear now when you fly if you get in a group early enough before they start taking bags and saying they need to check it. I recall the American Airlines gate person said something but let me go anyways. I truly do not think they realize how they irritate their passengers. So the end result of my final destination ended up the next American flight canceled and than I would have been without my suitcase. Sure I am sure in a day or two they would get it to me but not after additional inconvenience to their passenger that they treat with total disregard. Now for my good news my upcoming flight this week out of Ft. Lauderdale has already canceled no worries I rebooked out of Miami.
"Let's say it was the worst first class flight I have taken ever. I have had the pleasure of flying first class on most of my 20 plus annual flights across the US and in Europe. Today, I had the unfortunate opportunity to fly American Airlines from Fort Lauderdale to ORD to John Wayne Airport on the 6:30 am flight. I went to first class check in and not one person asked to offer help but stood around talking and looking the other way. They had no desire to help anyone despite there being more than 5 agents at the check in counter as shown in my photo.The next issue came on the flight the stewardess was rude like she got out of bed on the wrong side of the bed and we have not even taken off yet. This is going to be a long flight. Maybe American should work on it's customer service and model it after The Old Virgin Airlines which was great service, British Airways, Delta One, and Ermerits."
Overall American Airlines is not a bad company to fly with.  One thing I would wish they improve is their customer service while in flight.  The flight attendants just don't care even if something is wrong with your seat etc.  The airplanes seem to be old and some of the seats are messed up for sure with half the things working. The positives are that flights are on time. They have good drink options.  They give you a small snack with your drink which is decent. You can buy other food snacks if you want recharge in your body.  Lastly they have good options in tv and movie choices. Overall this is would not be my first airline company option to fly with but if it's a direct flight I would not mind using them again. They have decent rates for flying even though their employees need some retraining in customer service for sure.
"This is a review for this unbelievable one time pleasant customer service for an unaccompanied minor.I had prepurchased a rewards point ticket for my minor son to fly AA.  My phone reservation agent told me I had the option to call AA or go to the counter to pay the unaccompanied minor fee, which I chose the latter.Now my child is 13 and has been flying alone from point A to point B since he was 6.  AA forces even the most astute young travelers' parents to pay --in addition to the ticket price-- now $163 until the child turns 16 (when we started it was $50).  I guess they want to make sure if a child has to switch planes, but for a non-stop flight???? or an older travel savvy child? Grr.A bunch of stars for our check-in agent--she was chipper and efficient, friendly and comforting to both me and the child.  She even said she was embarrassed about charging the $25 checked bag fee (profit guilt, what? Lol).  The only thing I can think of that was glaringly annoying this visit, you may want to do which I now will try next time------- if you have a TSA pre check number, ask if they can attach it to your boarding pass (you get a boarding pass to walk your children to the gate).  My child's boarding pass was automatically TSA pre check, mine was not.  Since he was mature enough, I let him go through pre-check alone while I stood the regular long, depressing arse TSA line.  20 minutes later, I joined him on the other side. Grr....minus a few stars for not telling me at check-in desk about pre-check.Today was a good day, AA."
"I honestly love to take the time to appreciate peoples hard work here on yelp because I noticed people only leave reviews when there's a negative outcome. However I'm disappointed at the treatment I received here at terminal 3 at the 7:21 flight leaving to Dallas.My flight out of West Palm Beach Airport got cancelled without my notice, I managed to rebook for yesterday and had a two hour window. Unfortunately I wasn't able to make it and had to stay overnight to make this flight. I will be attaching a picture of an old boarding pass. It says ""doors close 10 minutes prior to departure"".I arrived at the gate a little over 20 minutes prior and could literally see the last person walking in while I walked towards the gate. The agent at the door looked at me with so much disgust and I'll be honest as a black man traveling I always make it a point to have a suit and tie on when I travel because I'm used to getting prejudiced a business professional outfit sometimes subsidizes it.I informed this agent on how I was well on time but a little frustrated due to having 3 reschedules already but he went ahead to let me know there was nothing he could do. He took my boarding pass and threw it in the trash and started to reschedule my flight. 15 minutes after he rescheduled my flight, the door agent helping people get situated on the flight came out and closed the door. I'm truly disappointed at the service I received today and i will go to extreme lengths to make sure someone high up sees this because I wouldn't want anyone else to have to go through this. Also I forgot to mention the same agent threw the new boarding pass at me Again nothing I'm not used to. I don't blame him, he was probably having a bad day and a lot of people do not know how to channel their frustration."
"AA changed our flight time and now we sit for 6 hours. They wouldn't take our luggage so we must sit in baggage claim until 4 hours before flight time.  It is inconceivable that AA's issue has become a huge waste of our time.  There are no earlier flights so I'm stuck.I would like to use our Admirals Club card and sit in a comfortable room but again, I can't get into the airport due to AAs change of flight The lack of compassion is evident in that there should be a way to have luggage held so that we can do something instead of sit.  They is a commercial luggage holding company but they're closed Tuesday and Wednesday!!!!!! And I'd have to pay!!!!!Very Poor Service!!!!"
"I will NEVER  FLY WITH AA. They didn't allow us to board our flight that had been delayed severalTimes and changed gates severalTimes as well. Flight departed at 9:30 pm, we were at 9:20 checking in and they did not allow us in. Many of us went through the sameSituation on this particular date/flight. They also even sold one of our seats, even though we had booked it months before. The lady behind the counter was ZERO helpful, didn't give a flying care about our situation and even walked away and left us there with no answer. If things like these happen, their attitudes should be better. Horrible customer service, horrible experience, which is why I'd rather fly with another airline. What a nightmare!!! - I'm just hoping now that my bag that went on this flight won't get lost.............."
"Ft. Lauderdale Customer service needs work!!!! Our flight that leads to 2 connecting flights home was delayed due to mechanical problems, which is totally understandable. The gate agent tried her best to get info and change flights as needed and keep passengers updated. However, along with 3+hrs of stress and confusion... we were directed to return to ticketing outside the airport... get our luggage from baggage claim and catch a shuttle from there to Miami. So we head to the ticketing as directed... and the service at ticketing is so slow... zero urgency... zero smiles... and only 2 ticketing workers helping customer service. Now we wait in a long line with fellow transferring passengers hoping we don't miss our flight in Miami. It is completely unacceptable to have ONLY 2 AGENTS working a ticketing counter for such a busy airport during mid day. Went I finally reach the front of the line, the agent (Isabel Cespedes) calls next... I get to her and I'm standing there waiting in front of her as she eats a candy and puts lipstick on and fumbles with her make up bag... again with ZERO urgency. Unbelievable. How RUDE ISABEL! When Isabel finally looked into our flight changes it seemed as though she had no idea what she was doing. Agent Shari came to help, finally some CUSTOMER SERVICE! She was great in fixing all the errors with our flight changes. She was very helpful and showed great care. She changed our flight to shuttle to Miami... fly to Dallas... overnight in Dallas... fly straight to Honolulu. She assured us everything would be ok and that the agents in Dallas will set us up in a comped room for our troubles. Thanks Shari! From there things went smoothly until we reached Dallas of course. Staff was rude, dismissive and slow. In Dallas we Bonnie was the agent to help us next. Bonnie directed us to eat as she looks for a hotel for us. She give us 2 meal vouchers, 1 $14 for dinner, 1 $7 for breakfast... for 2 people. Really? Everyone knows that is no sufficient for eating at the airport for 2. We ended up sharing a dinner meal since we had lost our appetite at this point and yet we still had to come out of pocket for the bill. When we return to Bonnie... it's after 10pm... and the airport is deserted. Bonnie tells us there is a concert in town and the rooms American Air are contracted with or sold out. Basically saying it's our problem now and we were on our own. She told me to have a seat n call hotels myself. I demanded a manager/supervisor and for BONNIE to find us a hotel as we were promised!!! This was so upsetting. Meanwhile she also tells us our luggage is waiting for us in baggage claim!!! 30 or so minutes later, Bonnie finds us a room and say we have to pay our own... give us a email address to bill American Air later and she directed us to demand reimbursement for hotel... extra expenses and time loss. Mind you, we never saw or spoke to any manager or supervisor... none came to assist. We then head to get our bag n take a shuttle to the hotel... but at this point no one is in the baggage claim area, not even our luggage and we then find out it's locked up. We get into our hotel after 11, and return to the airport at 7am. Could you believe they tried to force us to pay another baggage fee?!? Nope, not happening. And we didn't. We finally get on our flight home... the plane is trashed... musky... TV hue is so dark U can't even see what's playing... lavatory is dirty and toilet seat is pealing and discolored. DISGUSTING. And here's the kicker... the chair was he'd together by duck tape!!!!! Unbelievable. When we return home, we contact American Air to make our complaint and claim our money back and put in a good review for Shari (the agent in Ft Lauderdale). American Airlines has he nerve to only offer us a $200 travel voucher OR hotel reimbursement which may be less than what we paid. So basically, they make more money off of use or we get partial reimbursement. RUDE! What liars!!! We sent them our receipt for our hotel. Would you believe our hotel was only $120 and they sent us a check for only $89!!!! That doesn't even cover the room fee before taxes!!! CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP! I don't need your damn money American Airlines!!! It's the principle! Every American Airlines agent were in contact with (except Shari) have no clue what good customer service is nor do they care. This was by far the WORSE experience we've ever had from any company. What a disgrace to the name AMERICAN. They should definitely consider a name change... better yet, a shut down. We definitely WILL NOT be flying with American Air again. Thanks for the stress and migraine! Never again. $89... pathetic.Too bad I'm forced to pick A star... consider that star for SHARI!"
"Since my last experience (Tuesday and now today, and what's turning into tomorrow), I've vowed to never fly American again. The gate agent made the police come talk to us because we asked for contact info of the regional corporate rep and she said she felt threatened because I asked for that info. Even the police asked the gate agent why she wasted their time because I made a perfectly reasonable request.Now, I'm sitting in Fort Lauderdale, waiting for my delayed flight, to miss my connection, in hopes that they can find me another flight and get me home. Current outlook is 2am in Seattle. American is simply terrible, and acted very disrespectful. Don't fly with American, they are a disgrace to the name America."

"I have not flow in American Airlines in 20 years and today reminded why. Yes our group of three were late for our flight but they gave one person, a child, the boarding pass and then said sorry no new passengers flight is closed.  Their was 30 minutes prior to lift off and the customer service could not have been worse. Except for the Supervisor, who showed up after 30 minutes, the staff was rude, dismissive, talked about us in Spanish not knowing we understand some of it and their overall attitude was just plain rude.  American Airlines continues to live up to its horrible reputation. In my 48 years of life I have never witnessed such neglect for the customer.  Thanks for nothing American Airlines. I will continue to short your stock every time you have a temporary up tick due to low gas prices which you have nothing to do with."
"Today you made passengers from the Vegas red eye into Miami, wait 1.5 hours for their bags at 5am. When I complain at the counter the clerk told me that nothing could be done an the supervisor was in a call and would not pay attention to this disrespectful service to the passengers. There was no storm. Clerks at the bag counters were beyond careless. Shame on you American Airlines for treating passengers like this."
"Two out of the last three flights were delayed by over an hour and a half. Seems to be a trend. Both were due to mechanical issues. That is a little scary..... Both times, the attitude from AA reps was very nonchalant about the inconvenience this caused passengers and less than understanding."

Taking a flight this morning from Fort Lauderdale to Charlotte.  Since I connect with just 54 minutes between flights j carried a bag in.  The overheads hold just two bags when the row has three seats. A third of the plane had to check a bag delaying the flight and almost guaranteeing that I miss my connecting flight. A terrible experience.
It would never fly American again I'd rather drive. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They call the last group 9 for boarding 1 min before the 10 min gate close and refused to let me on the plane even though I had been standing in line the entire time. I call the 1800 number and wastes even more time. Just save yourself the headache NO STARS
"Not impressed with the operations of American Airlines on a recent trip from Port of Spain, Trinidad to Miami on Flight 2703. Started out with an hour delay to replace a life vest. Then after landing in Miami the cargo door would not open so that the luggage could be brought out. Imagine the stress on the kids, and the parents, at the end of a very long day, which could have been avoided. And, by the way, the same flight was canceled the previous day (January 13) for mechanical reasons as well. Is AA using duct tape and fishing lines to keep their equipment together?"
"Asked to speak to a manager.  After a 15 minute wait she came out and when we asked for her name and the name of the employee in question she became defensive, raised her voice and when I calmly asked to tell her my encounter she said ""we'll go ahead and tell me your story if it makes you feel better, not that it will matter anyway"" Wow... and someone promoted her.  Boo... doesn't even deserve 1 star"
I love flying with American Airlines. Our flight was cancelled on Friday and I cannot express the amount of stress that was. We had a 11am wedding to attend the next day and it did not look like it was going to happen. We were able to work with this gentleman unfortunately I did not get his name but he was able to get us in the flight before ours and able to change our connecting flight .granted when we got to Dallas our flight was cancelled and we had to drive 10 hours to our final destination to make it on time for the wedding but the customer service was amazing!

I was waiting to exit the plane from my flight last night (DFW to FLL) and this elderly man was patiently waiting to grab his bag from the overhead. I really wanted to offer him assistance but I was too far away. It really bothered me that no one offered this man help (he was even wearing a WWII vet hat). Alex immediately ran up to offer this man help with his luggage. I was so thankful for her running up and helping this man. She was so accommodating the entire flight.
"0 stars for this wretched, god forsaken airline. What an embarrassment of a product of humanity. Makes me wanna vomit."

Wow we should have read the reviews first. SCAMMING PEOPLE ON TRAVEL INSURANCE! Advice to avoid losing money when traveling ....step one: don't believe anything American airlines says step two:read the reviews step three:don't click purchase step four: fly another airline...or walk you get way more accomplished then sitting on hold while they try to collect MORE MONEY!......my mother had a medical emergency and now she's being released and we would like to be home for the holidays.....thank you American airline for not doing a damn thing!!Tis the season for these greedy pricks!
"Used to fly USAir but said never again 8yrs ago. Gave it a second chance today hoping that there were SOME improvements under the new name--- boy was I wrong. If you plan on switching flights, get ready to cough up $200 after the 15min wait on the phone since you can't make changes on-line.  Paying for ""choice"" seats buys you a regular old economy class seat with... Wait for it... A seat closer to the front of the aircraft with no extra seat or leg space. Oh yeah, and if you need to change your flight, the regular, closer to the front seat charge is non-refundable nor is it transferable. It wasn't all horrible. The plane was at least clean."
Late again. Standing around looking at an empty plane.. Late to board. Same as always.
"This review will be short and easy, because those are normally the kind of flights i have with AA. Is my #1 airline to flight with when i decide to take a trip. They are always on time and their costumer service over the phone is always prompt. The crew is always super nice. Some planes are better than other, but i dont mind things like that."
"worse airline ever!!! my flight got delayed due to airplane maintenance,this has happen before every time  i fly with american airlines seems like they don't have their maintenance schedule in a timely manner. i was showing some frustration and the lady working in airline had an attitude, their mistake and expect customer to be happy about it didn't show any concern whatsoever that your plans are screwed up due to their fault . she said your on the same boat as everybody else . bad customer service , i will never fly with americans airline ever!!!"
"Pathetic in every way. They can't do anything right. Shitty gate announcements, shitty seats, shitty loading unloading. Shitty customer service. Hate this airline."
"By far, the worst customer service of any airline I've ever flown. The employees at the boarding gates are so rude. They rush you and act as if you should know all the travel lingo and rules. It's a helpless feeling when your flight gets cancelled and you need direction. They do not help at all. They treat you as if you are an inconvenience. If you don't like your job and don't like providing customer service, go into a different profession and stop being so angry."
"I'm pretty sure I was told by a front desk attendant that I paid extra for a seat in the main cabin for no reason, and she moved me further back in the plane. A little disappointed that your website and attendants were not more informative. If I knows that the seats in the main cabin did not have extra legroom, I wouldn't have upgraded my seat."
Hurry up and wait. Die of thirst while waiting. I'm sticking with United. They get you boarded promtly then make you sit for over an hour.
"SERVICE ARE YOU KIDDING ME. NOT HERE. NO WAY ! NO HOW. I had an international ticket I had to cancel, they said I had one year to rebook so I called up and they said no, one year to travel. After eight form letters I said fine ,just give me the taxes nothing more that I paid, "" NO WE KEEP EVERYTHING""WAS THE ANSWER. When I had to cancel , Aero Mexico , United, Delta, and even the cattle car airlines Spirit gave me back my taxes where the only thing is free is air and the toilet paper. I have traveled many airlines, Air Berlin excellent, as well as Qantas , Jet Blue, Volaris, US air , Delta, United and Alaska but for rude personal and bad service pick American, We a group of 8 are going to Barcelona for a cruise in October and I would rather swim then take American. Good Luck and fly the friendly skies but not on American"
