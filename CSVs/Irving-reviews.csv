"Writing this revue, a month after our flight. I'd need time to calm down. I booked the one-way flight from Nashville (BNA) to Vancouver BC. (YVR) for September 11, 2022, on November 27, 2021. A full eleven before departure!! I'd paid up for First/Business Class. This was part of our Anniversary trip. Return trip was one way from Calgary (YYC) back to Nashville (BNA). FYI: it was least expensive than booking round trip.    The original flight was Nashville to Chicago, then onward to Vancouver via Air Canada. During the early part of 2022, American Airlines and Air Canada parted ways, (Oneworld Alliance). So, getting this reschedule was not fun. The computer system re-booked us automatically but with only 25 minutes between flights. Trying to get from a national terminal to an international terminal in 25 minutes is NOT going to work.   So, I called AA Customer Service and got through in a timely fashion, wow! The rep Chad was helpful and got us re-booked thru Dallas/Ft. Worth. So now we are going to Nashville to Dallas to Vancouver with a 2-hour layover. Nice!   About 2 weeks or so later I received an email from AA nothing a change to my flight from Dallas to Vancouver and that my seats were chained!?!? I was somehow bump/move from first class to main cabin on the second legged of our trip. (From 2 D, F to 10 E, F) So I called right away. A rep did a lot of research and spent 35 to 40 minutes with me. She believed that the flight (First Class) may have been sold out before the re-booking or*** that an AAdvantage member, Platinum status, Loyalty, miles, etc. tends to get first choice. She let on more than she should have. So much for booking early.   I call many times to get my seats moved back to first class but on luck. The day of our flight I talk to the gate agent, and she was not showing any First-Class seat available. When boarding the aircraft, I ask for the Purser and that I did to talk to her ASAP. She came to our seats, and I told her about the above situation. She said she would be back before push-back and if there are any seats in first that we may have them. There was only one and I offer it to my wife. She declines saying if we both cannot go that she would stay here. The Purser did let us know that we were/could get a refund for the difference once our flight was completed. Good to know.   We did get a refund of $327. We paid $1197 less the $327 equal $870 so it all work out, kinda.Overall, the flight left about 5 minutes early and arrived 15 minutes early, too. Did miss our meals but we got snacks!! (sarcasm) The flight crew was really good, and the aircraft was clean, Boeing 737-800. Note: we could not connect to the free Wi-Fi, but I downloaded a few movies to my laptop. It's a shame that a once great airline has become an over price budget airline,Just disappointed that we did not get what we paid for up front. I'll get over it one day, maybe..."
"Really sad that this company has a lot of good people working for it, but it's policies from leadership are NOT CLIENT CENTRIC at all!  They obviously forgot that not too many years ago their stock dropped to a penny stock, and our government helped bail them out financially.  This company goes to all-time lows to avoid refunding clients' money who did not get what they paid for.  You pay them to fly you to a destination, but instead they take you to another state involuntarily due to their problems, and said the ticket was ""used"" so no refund is warranted.  My lawyer agreed with me, and problem solved.  Again, sad to see a big company like AA bully their customers, and somehow think it's the right thing to do.  Maybe they have young/stupid leadership who doesn't understand short term gain, but long term bigger loss."
"Absolutely terrible airline. Sat on the plane today (10/25/2022) from FLL to DFW for a half hour after plane was suppose to depart, in literally 90 degree temps on the plane. I've never seen it take so long to board or deplane an aircraft and fly almost every week. Only fly American when I absolutely have to, terrible."
"This is our 3rd flight with American airlines in the last several weeks. If you want delays and subpar amenities at all levels then American Airlines is for you. Today, because we have a red-eye flight at 1:15AM from LAX to MIA we spent the extra  $$$$ to book a  1st class seat. Instead of a sleeper chair, we're in a standard chair...yet they still give us a blanket and pillow???? I'm 6ft 2in so what I'm going to do? Curl up in the seat with my pillow and blanket???  At this moment (we're not in the air yet) I have 5-6 inches between my knees and the front chair...then when they recline...make that zero. Since sleeping is not an option,  you have an InfoSystem to watch movies...WRONG...no InfoSystem system. Save the hassle and go with another airline."
"It is so bad!! I used to love American Airlines. And I have status with American because I travel so often between Dallas and LA! American was always my go to. But in the past two years just awful.The pandemic excuse had worn itself that it is unacceptable to use that as an excuse for the poor customer service, delayed and cancelled flights and THE HOURS OF HOLD TIMES!!! It is ridiculous. Most people not all but most staff seem so unhappy and unpleasant. This is is applied then to the customers. Just not a good travel experience when they are rude and not helpful and/or the customer service is awful. I had to hold for 5hrs literally! No weather challenges anywhere to blame. Then if you request a callback instead of holding that is very very hit or miss!! I wrote in and they said we are working to improve. Thanks for your comments! Yet hold times and customer service are still very ""Spirit Airlines-ish"" Please look into the areas as an undercover customer to see the stresses and disappointments. The customer service agents once on the call they are at least nice. The service desk in Dallas and LA hit or miss Orange County just getting you in and out not necessarily bad just not personable. And again there are some good people but its less than more. The Stewardess seem like when is this plane-going to land not happy. Several have mentioned being overworked and it shows! Pilots when face to face have always been friendly and seemingly happy! THANK GOD But AMERICAN please DO BETTER"
"Our trip from Tampa to Phoenix took off on time and arrived 30 min early!!!!!! :-)..... We were so happy about this. But review the situation below flight Attendant behavior  that was unacceptable forwarded on to AA Customer Service:7/28/2022To: Costumer Service        American AirlinesFrom: Bradford Hartwell / Sharelle Fisher            hartbc@sbcglobal.net / ssfisher1@gmail.com16801 N 94th Street #2006, Scottsdale, AZ 85260Re: Unacceptable Flight Attendant BehaviorRecord Locator: KIATRFFlight: AA1466Date of Travel: 07/28/2022Tampa - Phoenix (Sky Harbor)This morning's flight between Tampa and PHX was very alarming not to mention extremely uncomfortable and uncalled for.Shortly after takeoff the Captain announced that it was ok to move around the cabin. My wife Sharelle, got up to use the restroom. Since we had purchased up graded comfort economy seats right at the bulkhead dividing first class she got up to use the front facility. Within seconds, the First class flight attendant announced that there were three restrooms in the back and not to use the front of the cabin due to it being First class only.We had no problem with this. Minutes after she sat back down, the Black First class attendant flew around the bulkhead and began screaming at her. His voice was very loud and threatening. All passengers in the area could hear him. We tried to clam him down but he continued. At this point, my wife is shaking with fear. His reprimand lasted for quite a few minutes until he left.The rear flight attendants began to serve coach refreshments. Calmly my wife asked the tall male attendant what the name of this Attendant was. He expressed that she would need to ask him. Shortly after that, the First class attendant appears again and forces himself in front of my wife and begins to threaten her after she calmly asked him for his name. His response escalated to the point that I asked over and over for him to ""clam down"". He continued to threatens her that he will report this to the Captain and that she will be ""met at the gate""? ""If you think you are going to catch a connection, your mistaken"". ""I will make sure that you will not make your connection"".At this point, a passenger behind us speaks up and asks the attendant to calm down. The attendant fly's back to the man trying to assist and began threatening and arguing with him.This situation clams down. Needless to say, both of us are extremely shaken up and worried what will happen. As a gesture, the young lady sitting next to us offers her phone number if we need help.About 20 minutes later, a young Mom with her daughter heads up to the First class restroom. She is allowed to use it. 15 minutes later, another passenger heads towards the First class restroom and she is also allowed to use it.At the end of the flight, the First class attendant appears again with an American Airlines stationary card and apologizes for his actions. This was very fine and nice as I shook his hand and expressed, I appreciated his honesty.We have his apology card that still is not signed with his name. We believe that action should be taken to correct this individual's attitude as it is not representative of American Airlines. If we were to exhibit this type of behavior we would have been arrested. Brad & Sharelle"
"While flying from Phoenix to Santa Barbara on 8/5/21 this was my experience. So the young man in seat 16 c across from me just wouldn't keep his mask on even though it is a federal mandate. He had a backpack on that read  #67Cal-Poli Football.Even though we were told about the mask mandate I had to tell the flight attendant to please ask him to pull his mask up Several times. It was very upsetting to me and I felt sorry for the young lady who had to sit next to him. next I would like to mention how dirty the plane was and how awful the snack was, if you could call it that. It was a packet of ""Love Corn"" which was really hard and inedible. Lastly we sat on the tarmac for a half an hour but arrived on time because they add a half hour on so it looks like they were on time. They really need to get their act together."
"American Airlines will never get our business again. My boyfriend and I hauled a*s through an airport (DFW to be exact, which is no easy task) to try to catch an earlier flight to get home to our sick dog because half the plane was open. Rather than letting us board, they told us we needed to pay $50 to switch flights back at customer service. When we asked if we could call and pay and then board, they told us that no one could be let on the plane as the doors were closed. As we walked away, another man who was running late ran up to the gate and had the door held open by a great woman named Jo Anna (please sense my sarcasm). Jo Anna and Michelle definitely did as little as possible and lost American Airlines two customers. Do not fly American if you'd appreciate some decent customer service. Happy holidays to us!"
"It was the first time I felt comfortable at flying since the start of covid.  Smooth was the last minute purchase of my RT tickets for the dates in late August, 2020.  Alert was given of one of my flights being very full and option of exchanging ticket.Better than ever, efficient check ins and on time departures. Impeccable was the service.  Though the planes were properly cleaned, I still brought out my wipes in wiping down everything I was about to touch. So happy to be flying once again.CHEERS!"
"I have been trying to book a flight on AA.com their app for 2 DAYS!I changed my password, and still cannot log in. I have a hyphenated name which they don't allow and now I am blocked.The audacity of they 800 phone message that AA cares about helping us quickly just makes my blood boil as they go on to explain how they can call you back in1-2 hours.Seriously. I feel as though I am at the dentist. Apparently AA corp has been paying its CEO millions of dollars and not any money to update their app nor hire actual people - real agents who can HELP"
"If I could give it a 0 I would. Don't waste your time with this airline as they have a tendency to ruin vacations with layovers and delays, along with no refunds on situations that they cause. Fuck this airline. 0 out of 10"
Headed back to Dallas 4:45am. Arrived at CSG on AA this trip. One of the AA rep represented AA by showing the horrible customer service early in the morning. I CANNOT believe I didn't say a word. I equate it to only 2hrs (if that) of sleep last night.  Way to show off poor customer service skills AA and way to show lack of home training skills to the AA rep.
"If I could give zero stars, I would. AA is the most incompetent airlines I've ever had to deal with. I booked flights four months in advance to Houston from LAX, both flights there and back were direct flights. Got a decent price for them, should have known it was going to be an issue because of the price, ""You get what you pay for."" So I get an email on July 7th, 2019 saying that both my flights have been changed. My flight there was a changed to a later departed and arrival time than what was originally booked, which was inconvenient because I had some things planned for when I arrived in Houston. Now that my arrival time was later, I was landing at 11pm and having to pick up my car and go to my hotel, it was almost 1am. So my first day was ruined because they decided to randomly change my flight. But I didn't think much of it and just went along with it, because what am I supposed to do? The real problem was the departure flight back home to California. It was a literally nightmare. Our flight departure time was 1:48pm. Got to the airport around 12pm to go through TSA and be ready on time to board. When we got there and sat down waiting, they delayed our flight. No problem, things happen sometimes, but then they delayed my flight once more, again, I was okay with it because maybe this would be the last delay then we would finally get on a plane and take off...but no, they cancelled it. They cancelled my direct flight home from Houston to LAX. I had to go over to the booking counter to rebook my flight which was a total zoo because there were about 20 people ahead of me. I rebooked my flight and was able to get on a flight that afternoon but with a connection in Dallas. The airplane arrives for the flight to Dallas. Me and all the passengers make our way onto the plane. We sit on the plane for about and hour and a half. The pilot speaks onto the intercom two times stating that we can't take off because he's waiting for a log book. We sit on the plane for almost TWO HOURS. Finally, they deplane us. They now say that the plane we are on is going to take off at 8:00pm. So I wait. 8pm comes around and they change the take off time to 10pm!!! At this point, it's 8pm and we've been at the airport since 12pm. I'm tired and I have work the next day which I had to call in and miss because the incompetence of American Airlines. Because this plane didn't take off, I missed my connecting flight in Dallas to LAX.At this point, I just decided to ask American Airlines to comp us a hotel and start all over again the next day. They compensated our hotel and rebooked our flights. They were nice enough to do that but the kicker is...two couples who were in the exact same situation we were in regarding the direct flight being cancelled and being rebooked on the flight where we sat there for two hours, they didn't get their hotel compensated. American wouldn't compensate their hotel. Why would they do that for us and not for them if they were in the exact situation? I felt so bad for them. The agents for American kept making excuse after excuse as to why they wouldn't compensate them a hotel. It was absolutely ridiculous.So, the next day we started over. We had our flights booked. When I get to the airport, my flight is DELAYED AGAIN, to the point where I was going to miss my connecting flight in Dallas, this is the next day! I had to go to the agents AGAIN to have them put me on an earlier flight so I wouldn't miss my connecting flight in Dallas. And you guessed it...that flight too was delayed. It was a literal nightmare. Even though it was delayed, I was still able to make my connecting flight in Dallas. Finally made it to Dallas and you guessed it, that flight was delayed as well. Only it wasn't that stressful because it was just the flight back home so I didn't have to make any connecting flights. When I get to baggage claim at LAX, I get a text saying that 1 of my 2 checked bags is delayed. We only checked one bag at the gate because they wouldn't allow our bag in the overhead compartment because the flight was full and they didn't have any room. The bag then arrives at baggage claim. How do you mess that up?On top of it all, the flight attendants aren't that nice...they are just okay.This is definitely a failing airlines that I don't see being in business much longer. If they can't even keep from having that amount of delays and mishaps, how can't they stay in business?I will never ever fly AA ever again. I learned my lesson with this one. I will tell everyone I know to never fly American. I am done."
"Generally speaking have had really poor experiences with American Airline. At this airport in particular, we were told that the pilot was delayed getting to the flight, after we were already seated and told we'd be taking off shortly. We than proceeded to sit on the run way with no update for about 30 minutes. Miscommunications happen but the process was handled poorly. The biggest issue is the space. It is clear that both the aisle and seat sizes have been reduced. So, other issues, aside the fact that the flight was physically painful made it unbearable. I literally could not fit between the two girls next to me (we were all about the same size) and we each spent three hours trying to get comfortable. Staff is relatively friendly but nothing can substitute for not feeling both  uncomfortable and self conscious in an already anxiety filled situation... flying"
"Greetings,Let me start off by saying that I regretted ever having Americans Airlines as my number one choice to fly for this trip VLDZFG. I've been flying American Airlines since the late 1990's and early 2000's back and forth into Haiti with my family with no issues. The time I decided to choose American Airlines to fly to a particular trip into Thailand, they not only let me down. But when I showed up at the check-in desk at the airport the lady checking my bags told that my connecting flight into Japan to Thailand is not going to happen because Japan is closed and not allowing tourist to connect through it. The American Airlines Agent noted my file telling me about the cancelation of my flight saying that Japan is going to open Nov 15,2021. I've book this ticket since October 1, 2021, I prepared in advance with my job to get the requested time off and now your going to tell me that a major company that I trusted and believe in since I was a child deceive me into purchasing the ticket to Thailand when they know that the connecting flight was not valid. That is just unacceptable in all accounts, you don't sell tickets to customers that is going to deceive them, that's a big red flag and dirty business. Taking the customers trust, and misleading to purchase tickets to later give them flight credit is a scam to the customer. As a major company that represents the United States in the Airline industry you don't deceive your customers into purchasing something that is for future use, that is not fair and not the American way of doing business, we call that a scam. Also to make matters worse, I spoke to the reservation agent and supervisor at American Airlines about the issue, they told me to submit a request for refund and I would receive my funds back to my card because of the matter, because they had to cancel my flight. I check my email this morning in Thailand, and the email said your ticket is not eligible for refund 0012302169199. I want to American Airlines and I would never thought I would ever come on here to write such review because of the high regards I had, but you're a scam to deny my refund of funds to my card and offer flight miles when you arrange a connecting flight that was not possible because Japan is closed off to tourist, American Airlines that is a scam. I would never forget this or trust you guys, and yes Delta does have valid routes into Thailand connecting through South Korea. I want my funds refunded back to my card and want to fly American Airlines ever again if your going to scam me out of my money by giving me flight miles. I've work hard for that money not to have back to my card. I want my money back. I didn't cancel the flight you guys did. I want my money back, that is not fair dealing with customers like this. Why deceive customers into purchasing your tickets to your business and give them the service. That is dirty business dealing. I want my funds refunded back into my card, I do not want your air miles. That is not the way to go with a customer because of your own mistakes, I want my money back. You don't gain a customer trust by doing that. I want my funds back to my card please. I don't want to be scam. And if I don't get it, I'll make sure the world knows of how dirty you guys are doing business. That is not fair. I want my funds back into my card."
"Well where should I start? First let me state I'm a executive platinum member of America airlines. In fact I've been a loyal member of this airlines for years but I'm starting to see a bigger picture. The service has become very less than satisfactory. The majority of the flight attendants simply don't seem to really care whether your happy or not. I've had several get very snippy with me in fact. When you are executive platinum you are given system wide upgrades. I'm not really sure why they give you these as every time I have tried to use one they say sorry not usable on this international flight. Meanwhile I boarded my flight to Lima tonight and noticed 3 empty seats in business class. What the hell American. I've noticed so many planes are so dated as well. This plane to Lima has no entertainment in the seats at all. This is a 7 hr flight. I seriously could go on and on. I've be loyal for almost 15 years. Meanwhile friends tell me how great they have it on Delta and how good they are treated. Not one flight attendant even has acknowledged that I'm executive platinum. They just treat to you like cattle ! Or should I say like SHIT! American this loyal member of your airline is pissed ! Plus on a recent trip to Asheville you all ripped my wife's bag and when I went to report it I was basically told tough luck buddy move along . Every year way over $25,000 is used on your airline. Pretty sure I'm pretty done !!!! Oh just to add to this AA also lost my bag just now. Neat!"
Garage airlines ! Do not fly they will leave you behind schedule you for next morning and make you sleep like dogs on floor and even give you snacks ! Legit worst experience ever ! Don't ever fly American Airlines ever again ! Unless if you want to be lied to and sleep on mcdolands floor with out pillow or blanket ! Legit jail cell!
"Arrived at connecting flight 8 minutes before it departed--weather delay.   Door shut just as before I arrived, but Agent generous enough to walk down to see if they would load arrivees as more folks were showing up.  By the time she got back, there were at least 2 dozen of us waiting to board the flight.    American refused to board us though we were probably 1/4 of the scheduled passengers.  Put on stand-by for the next flight and seated for the next flight after that--10 hours later.    About every flight was weather impacted--was utterly rediculous they wouldn't let us on the plance as common sense dictated getting us onboard instead of pushing us off to later flights."
"Our flight was canceled (which wasn't the problem).  The issue that I had, about this airline, was an employee that was extremely rude...on purpose.  I needed to ask where to go to rebook 2nd leg of flight.  When I tried to ask this employee, ""Excuse me sir"", he ignored me.  I tried again, thinking that maybe he didn't realize that I was speaking to him, but he kept walking away.  I tried for a 3rd time.  He finally stopped and said, ""were you just on the flight from Atlanta?"".  I responded, ""no, but I just have a generic question"".  He waved his hand around saying, ""then I can't help you"" and walked away.  Another employee witnessed this and asked me how she could help.  I said that I just needed to know where to go to rebook a flight that was canceled.  She gave me the information.  Because of the extremely rude employee, I don't ever plan to fly with American Airlines again (unless it's my only option and if it's an emergency).  Never in my entire life have I ever had an employee, with any company, be so blatantly rude.  And on one of the legs of our flights, the fold down trays were obviously dirty which tells me that their cleaning is to be desired.  We are in a pandemic and cleaning should be more important than ever.  Customer service and cleanliness is not a priority for this this airline.  Very disappointed!!!!  (Oh, and they don't respond to emails).  I waited (flight was in December) before posting this hoping that I would hear back from them.  Nope!!!"
"Again on return trip, the American Airline employee requiring passengers to use VeriFLY before obtaining a boarding pass had no idea how to utilize the VeriFLY app!  Every single person in front and in back of me required assistance with no attendant capable of assisting.  Other passengers ended up having to assist other passengers.  Brilliant AA, you never hesitate to disappoint!!!!"
