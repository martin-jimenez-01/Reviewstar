"This review is solely for Kelly Livingston who was working at Philadelphia airport, gate A11, on July 26, 2022. Kelly is the most impressive airline employee I have ever encountered. We were flying back to SD from Paris, with a stop in Philadelphia. After boarding our plane in PHL, our flight was canceled and rescheduled for the next day. As you can imagine, there were a number of angry and frustrated passengers who then had to wait in an extremely long line for hotel vouchers to spend the night in Philadelphia. Kelly was one of the AA employees working at the desk giving out vouchers. At first, there were other employees, but they all left while there were still numerous passengers waiting for their vouchers. We were among those passengers, with our exhausted 5-year-old in tow. Other passengers were yelling and cursing at the AA employees, which was obviously very stressful for them--but Kelly handled all of this exceptionally well. She just kept working and never said a negative word or had the slightest bit of attitude. Eventually, even her manager abandoned her and Kelly was left to work completely alone! When I thanked her for staying (we were among the last in line), she smiled and replied very calmly and kindly--which was much appreciated after an international flight and not sleeping for close to 24 hrs. We were exhausted and just as frustrated as the other passengers, but were so incredibly grateful that Kelly was there to help remedy an otherwise awful experience.  She should absolutely be promoted! Few people can keep calm and work efficiently in such an intensely stressful situation. Thank you so much, Kelly!!"
Terrible!! Canceled flight and terrible customer service: 7 employees and only one to assist. Armando and Ariana at the front desk was extremely unhelpful; talking with his coworker and not worried about supporting us or getting us to our destination. He kept rolling his eye when I asked a question.I will not fly American Airlines anymore due to the terrible experience of cancellation overnight and Armando support the following day was the Cherry on the top.I saw him go up to his manager afterwards to try and excuse himself but his support was unexceptional
"This is a review strictly of Flight AA 1367 that leaves daily at 6:25 am from SAN (San Diego) bound for PHL (Philadelphia). I needed to be in Philadelphia for a memorial service for a dear friend from Los Angeles who recently passed away,  who originally hails from Philadelphia. I had heard the ground personal of American Airlines can be crabby, but I only experienced efficiency and kindness. When I was having trouble tagging my own bag, someone was right there to offer a helping hand. The plane boarded on time as scheduled. First Class is the first five rows, two abreast. I was in seat 3F. Be aware it is not international First Class, so don't expect vast comfort. Nonetheless, it was roomy and just fine for the anticipated five hour flight.  A glass of Champagne and a Bloody Mary were perfect for the 6:00 am boarding and they are offered before taking off, which is always a luxurious touch. There was a bearded steward who was in charge of the First Class cabin and he did a good job, with a mixture of efficiency and humor.  The Cheese Omelette served for breakfast was good and the drinks were offered non-stop (many people opted for Mimosas). We arrived in Philadelphia early. What more can a passenger ask?"
"Flying American Airlines from San Diego was rather painless. I did fly first class, which was quite nice although we did have a delay in San Diego due to filling up the plane with gas or something like that. It was okay for me because I had a short layover in Phoenix and I was going to board the same plane anyways, so I did not have to run to another gate.We were offered drinks before we took off but there were no snacks involved. The lady next to me requested mixed nuts and she was given three bags, but I had my earphones on so I did not get to ask when she did. So I just skipped the mixed nuts. Typically when I fly from Las Vegas, they offer you a snack even if it's a short flight but from San Diego we had to request it, even in first class.Not much to complain about because I guess that would be first world problems, right? The seats were comfortable and roomy, there was a lot of space and the stewardess was extremely nice."
"One of the worst airlines and terrible customer service. They have absolutely no critical thinking skills. I only fly with them if there is no other option. They charge an arm and two legs with terrible customer service. No flight delay or cancellation, just nasty customer service!!!!! I guess they forget our airfare keeps them employed."
"Flying American into or out of San Diego always seems to be extra painful. The week of COMICON, when there are a million passengers in and out, there were only two representatives at the check in kiosks. The lines were needlessly long as a result. Always feels like American is running cattle cars instead of airplanes. Fed up, I am switching entirely to Alaska Airlines."
"American Airlines wastes its customers time by overbooking, failing to plan a flight schedule with capacity of crew, and delays for whatever it can. Don't fly AA."
American Airlines is the worst airline I have ever used. The last 3 times I used I have had either a cancelled flight that caused me to lose a vacation day and the last 2 were business flights that were delayed 4 hours or more. They consistently fail to meet my basic expectations for service.
"This is for you Pam. I was on my return home when I met up with Pam. She was the most welcoming sight for me that day. You know, let's be honest, traveling can be a hassle and the LAST thing you want is a grumpy ticket agent. Unfortunately I had to go to the counter to check in and the anticipation was bothering me. But there was Pam to help. She was the most helpful and eased my worries! Thank you so much!"
"I traveled on American Airlines back in February. One of the employees removed my leather jacket from my luggage. I filed a claim which didn't help matters one way or the other. After speaking with an central luggage representative I needed to produce a receipt. The actual piece of luggage arrived a day later than me. I had to return to the airport to retrieve my luggage. I was never compensated for my leather jacket. I was given the run around by airline employee. Flying American Airlines has put bad taste in my , I will go out of my way not to use them ever again."

"Highly do not recommend this airline if you are traveling with surfboards, as you can see from the photo that's how your luggage will be treated"
Just wanted to give a shout out to the nice woman in Regan airport DC.  We are from Sandiego and flew to Virginia to run Marine Corps marathon after the run Sunday we hauled to Airport in DC to catch flight.. we were exhausted and we were spose go to Orlando we had room reservations.  As we approached the terminal we got text flight canceled.  We had already turned in our rental car and waited in long line to talk to an American employee.  Luckily we got a lady that was super helpful didn't get her name but she was from Puerto Rico she tried everything to help us even though she couldn't we were just grateful she cared and tried.  In todays Society in the US it is far and few to find caring employees.
"I have to give a rave review to customer service rep Linda M. from Raleigh, NC.  She was amazing and to ok the time to help with my situation.  I had to switch flights last minute from Orlando because my grandmother was sick with covid and get to Savannah.  I had a 4 hour layover in Miami and needed to get back to my expecitng wife that next morning.  I was stressed beyond belief and she worked it out for me to see my sick grandmother 1 last time and also make it back home to see new life.This kind of service is a lost art.   She is amazing!!!"
"What a terrible airline! Boy, they just don't understand customer service at all. There is the scent of resentment among the employees, from the gate attendants to the flight attendants and everyone in between. Everybody gets a middle seat unless you pay an upcharge, and we flew with an empty row a few seats up from our entirely full row. None of the flight attendants asked if we wanted to spread out a bit! They were too busy joking and essentially ignoring us!I won't ever fly Spirit because it's known to nickle and dime you to death, but at least it's a known issue. AA has lowered the bar so much, it's as if we have no choice in carriers. Nope!"
"Literally just dropped off my husband for his flight that was scheduled to leave at 8:48am only for him to find out AT THE GATE that you MORONS changed his flight TO ONE THAT HAD ALREADY LEFT AND NEVER NOTIFIED HIM!!!! Furthermore, he is allowed one FREE check in bag because he and I are BOTH American Airlines credit card members AND IT STATES SO ON YOUR TERMS. But when he went to check in his bag he was told that he needs to be the ""primary"" card holder EVEN THOUGH YOUR TERMS STATE THAT UO TO 4 additional ppl can check in a bag for free! Absolute worst airline company! WE WILL NEVER USE AMERICAN AIRLINES EVER AGAIN."
Left passengers stranded on runway for over 6 hours in Dallas Texas. Refuse to be honest with passengers about not having a flight crew scheduled. One passenger raised his hand to ask a question and was bullied by the Dallas Customer Service Representative Samantha. Samantha either meds to attend remedial trading or be fired. The worst airline carrier in the United States hands down.
"I am so disappointed in American Airlines I had never chose the airline before, so I decided to use it for my mother-in-law and sister-in-law to go from San Diego to Cancun what a big mistake I will never use this airline ever again the employees didn't know what was going on everybody had a different answer to a question to the same question they were not helpful they just messed up everything they made my mother-in-law and sister-in-law lose their flights they didn't care so avoid using this airline am it it it is horrible it is absolutely horrible with the WORST SERVICE!!!! Except for a gentleman name Sunny He was the only one trying to help them. If it wasn't for him I put zero stars."
"I flew American Airlines for the first and last time ever this past Tuesday, May 10th. It was by far not just the worst flying experience, but the most frustrating and stress inducing flying experience I have ever had. Initially, my flight (flight# 5666) was scheduled to depart from Augusta, GA on Monday, May 9th at 10:50am EST. Moments before the scheduled departure, an announcement was made that the aircraft was needing maintenance, the flight would be delayed for an undetermined amount of time, and the airline attendants were passing out the customer service phone number to start the rebooking process. None of the agents were able to assist with rebooking in person and the custome service phone number lead to extremely long hold times and multiple disconnected calls. No one I spoke with sounded confident that they could assist. I was rebooked for the next available flight at 2:05pm EST. After waiting several hours at the airport, 2:05 came and went with no news about our flight. Eventually, we were advised well after we were supposed to have departed that the flight was delayed again due to maintenance with no expected turn around time. Again, we were advised to phone the customer service line to rebook. At this point, I needed to also rebook my connecting flight since I would be missing that as well. I called customer service and rebooked yet again for a flight (flight# 6019) departing at 4:15pm. At 4:15, I proceeded to the gate to board and was advised that I was NOT on the list for that flight. Again was told to contact customer service to start rebooking. When I contacted customer service, I was advised that I should have boarded the 4:15 flight. I told them what happened on the gate and the agent stated they may not be able to get me on a flight until May 11th. At this point, I asked for a supervisor and was told that I need to ask for a supervisor in person, which I did. The agent at the gate radioed for a supervisor multiple times but never received a response. I continued waiting around at the airport for the original delayed flight. I checked estimated departure times via the website since none of the agents were updating us. The departure times updated on the website continued to pass. Finally, around 6:00pm, after waiting at the airport since 9:00am, I was rebooked for a flight the following day, Tuesday, May 10th at 10:50am EST. Aside from the stress and anxiety of the situation, I suffered lost wages at work and had to make accommodations for food and lodging. No such accommodations were offered by the airline, so I had to pay out of pocket. When I arrived at the airport the following day, the issues continued. When trying to board the flight, I was told again that I was not on the list. I explained the situation and ended up having to wait until the entire flight was boarded to be told that I was ok to board. After boarding the flight, the departure time again came and went while we sat still. Eventually, the pilot made an announcement that there was yet another delay due to a weight and balance issue... that issue was caused due to all the excess luggage on board from the delayed flight the previous day. I expressed my concern to the flight attendant about missing my connection and was advised yet again to call customer service to file a complaint. At 11:51am EST, our flight finally departed.. over a 25 hour delay! After returning home, I have tried countless times to get ahold of American Airlines for a refund via phone, email, and website. Everytime I call, I go through extended hold times only to be told there are no agents who can assist me over the phone and I have to file a complaint online which I had already done. Yesterday, the airline issued me a flight credit via email which is completely useless to me since I will not be flying American Airlines again. When I responded back to the email, it did not go through. I had to call customer service yet again, received the same response about not being able to assist, and again directed to the website. This has been an extremely taxing and stressful experience. I am urging everyone I know to avoid American Airlines so they do not have to go through the same experience I did. I am still awaiting a resolution and response. I wish I could give 0 stars."
Flew American and my flight was delayed and barely made my connecting flIght.  I was told food for purchase would be avail on all my flights.  what do you know no food for purcha on any of my flight.  I'm diabetic and went 10 hours without eatin.  Come on America!!!!!!!!!
"We had a trip planned for 3 days,2 nights from San Diego to Atlanta. We were to leave a Friday night to arrive Saturday morning. As we waited to board , 15 mins after our boarding time did they notify us that they didn't have the staff, and the flight would be delayed until first flight tomorrow morning ( Saturday). What's worst is that next flight did not put me and my husband together , he had to pay more to secure we would be seated together. And instead of our connection to Miami.  We were rerouted to Dallas( the worst to get through if you've ever traveled ). We got to Dallas and almost missed the connecting flight to Atlanta. They were boarding as we landed. We hauled a$$. Felt confident. Arrived in Atlanta to see our luggage didn't make it. We tried asking  and calling but of course no one knows anything. We eventually tracked at later that night and seen it would be coming next in next flight from Dallas. Of course no thanks to them.  So we had to drive back to airport ( I mean we had to. We had traveled all day and had no clothes. Yes we could've bought more but hoped for the best) to collect our luggage. Which was circling on baggage claim area. AA did not help find or advice us in any way that this could happen.  That they scheduled us back to back for flights.  We lost a whole day ( Saturday ) stressed out. The morning of return flight, we got a notification on phone that this fight would be delayed by two hours. Which in turn had us sitting for 4 hours at Dallas before getting our connecting flight  to San Diego. Which again didn't help us as we needed to get home., and again charged to sit next to each other. it's a complete disruption and inconvenience to plans already set. All in all not recommended and not the best customer service"

"This has to be the worst airline in America...Both America's and all three if there are any airlines in Central America.Every time I fly American, which is as seldom as possible, there's an issue and they don't care.  When flying you encounter a lot of airline employees and on my recent trip, not one of them smiled or was friendly.  This tells me they are not happy employees.  When you are a crappy company you get unhappy employees therefore, based on my experience, I summize  that between unhappy employees and botched flights, American is not a well run company.Given my consistently bad experiences with American, I could not recommend them."
"My wife and have been trying to re use a flight voucher from American Airlines for months and every time we try to book a flight, they have a rule implemented that does not allow us to use the voucher. This is a terrible airline. Try to use another if possible."
"4 stars for the destinations available...but, minus one star for airfare costs and baggage.Super small seats and very little leg room. So ridiculously uncomfortable.This plane looks old and worn on the inside. Could barely read the seat numbers which resulted in a mix up of a couple people sitting in the wrong row...including me. Just looking forward to a safe trip. If this was longer than 3 hours I'd have to ask for an upgrade to larger seats."
"Honestly 0. My car seat was not there! And I waited about 15-30 mintes! Luckily I had an extra car seat, but they did not have my car seat and they cannot deliver just because I had no claim! I waited at the office for 15-30 to make a claim! Way too long considering it was midnight! You did not deliver my car seat at the time of the baggage claim! THEY CALLED ME THE NEXT DAY AROUND NOON! That's on you to deliver my car seat! American Airlines, do better."
"Flew from San Diego to Miami via American Airlines. The seats were kind of uncomfortable, for some weird reason my seat wouldn't recline and neither would my friend's. Broken chairs or maybe the seats don't recline on AA? The seats don't have personal tv monitors. I usually fly Virgin America and I'm used to being able to control what to watch. They show one movie for the whole plane. Our flight was delayed by 30 minutes. The experience was just alright but not the best airlines I've been on."
"Is there less than 0 stars I would put, the American Airlines hiring criminals and thieves, they broke the lock to my bag and they opened it and stole my belongings, more than $10k  worth of clothes and shoes, the American Airlines they are working with these employees to steal their customers, as they don't want to compensate me or open investigation and look through their Cameras, to see who stole and invade my privacy, and give me my things back. Don't travel with this company, they are the worst just group of gangsters"
"I had a credit card through American Airlines where you earn points for travel. There is a yearly fee which is about $100 . I was planning to cancel my card so I wanted to use all of my points before they expired. I had about 90,000 points so we used it to go from San Diego to Las Vegas. The funny thing is you can use the points for hotels and rent a car but you have to include a flight . After using our points the flight, hotel and car rental was about $250. It was a good price but the flight had a 2 hour lay over in Phoenix. That's right we pass Vegas and wait at a Phoenix airport for about 2 hours. If it was only 2 hours ...the plane was actually delayed 4 hours! I could have driven there faster! The seating was so full on the 2nd half of the flight I couldn't sit next to my husband. It was weird because when we were boarding the plane this stewardess held me back . Her grip felt like a Kung Fu grip even though she told me to wait I waited patiently but she kept this grip on my shoulder. She finally let me go. She reminded me of the stewardess on Meet the Fockers. Just holding people up for no reason. It was a good deal but all of the delays drove me nuts."
"New ads I'm sure you've seen for American Airlines:""American Airlines:  You'll fly us because your only other last-minute travel option is Spirit!""""American Airlines.  Proud to bump you to middle seats across the country, because if you really wanted legroom, you'd walk to Philadelphia instead!""""American Airlines.  Don't like our cancelled and overbooked flights?  Feel lucky that we've grounded our 737MAX's and you will make it to your final destination, someday!""""American Airlines.  Jam your toes against a bulkhead, rub elbows and shoulders with strangers on both sides, but do it with a smile, because You're in Main Cabin Extra!"""
Exhausting airline to deal with. They give zero f*cks. Flying spirit might actually be better. Try harder American.
"Two stars because I actually made my flight. This by far the worst experience I've had checking in for a flight. The lady was so slow, extra talkative, doesn't pay attention and gave me the wrong ticket. Almost charge me twice for my one bag. I had to be like ma'am you swiped my card already. Had it not been for TSA paying attention I wouldn't have been able to make my flight like howwwwww. This why I'm a JetBlue person"

"The gate agent in San Diego, Robert, was so rude. I was having trouble getting my boarding pass on American Airlines website. He yelled at me to get out of line and preceded to berate me for not having it ready. Robert didn't need to take his anger out on me because he was having a bad day. All I wanted to do was get on the plane and sit down. There was no reason to be so awful to me."
"Not spectacular but on time and the most flights to Charlotte so looks like I will be using them more often.A bit of history.  Reunion with a Daughter my Ex and I had given up for adoption 47 years ago and this was the reunion.Ended up flying out to San Diego via United with a stop in Houston and this was the nonstop flight back from San Diego to Charlotte.Had to get up at 4 am and leave the Holiday Inn Express in Carlsbad shortly there after to return the car to Hertz and take the shuttle to the terminal, go through TSA to catch my flight at 7 am.Made it with time to spare.Picked up a cup of coffee from Peets and settled in to wait for my gate call.Maybe it was the early morning and flights had not been delayed yet and things were not backed up in the system but we were called and boarded and as the Sun was coming up over San Diego, we were lifting off on time.Bittersweet part of the trip because I had looked for this Daughter all these years, had found her and now was flying back.  I will be back later this year.Flight was uneventful and we actually landed about 15 minutes early and got our luggage in record time.Good flight and any uneventful flight is a good flight."
"I never flew with these people due to all the negative viral videos you see with this specific company .. and honestly it's starting to seem that they allow "" politicians "" to Rome Fred with no mask on board but if you are a regular person well you better put on your mask oh and it better not have an American flag .. because AMERICAN airline seems to prefer its passengers wearing Chinese communist party masks and uniforms instead. I truly hope your company the owner and c e o all of you rot for the communists you truly are. Fire that pilot in your most recent negative viral video. And quit forcing your employees to get an experimental vaccine."
"Worst airline ever!!!! Always late and overbooked, I fly cross country once a month and I have to work really hard avoiding American Airlines because it's a sure thing it's going to be late, and if you have a connection, you will miss it because of the incompetence of an lack of support!!!!! I really don't know why the government bailed them out, no one's job were at risk, they would just move to the other airlines that would glad picked up the work, and better yet, we would have better service and reliable flights, like with the other airlines"
"I'm sooo annoyed! I should not be in the awkward position of having to ask the passenger in the seat next to me to wear a mask. I was on a flight from DFW to San Diego and a guy comes onto the plane not wearing a mask. He can't find his seat so takes the empty one next to me. I was excited about the extra leg room of empty seat because I had a leg injury, but the flight attendant let's him sit in the empty next to me instead of showing him his correct seat 10 rows back. During the whole interaction the guy wasn't wearing a mask and noone seemed bothered.  For the next 10 minutes I stew in the seat next to him not wanting to be mask police but not wanting to possibly get my granddaughter sick when I see her the next day. Meanwhile the speaker system puts out the covid 19 message about noone being allowed to take their mask off at any time, serious offense, taking all precautions,  bla, bla bla. I was furious that the flight attendant came back to ask me to put my backpack up, but still not asking him to mask up. At that instant I asked the guy if he had a mak and he pulled a bandana out of his pocket. I then spent the next 30 minutes with him being pissed at me about calling him out on it! It shouldn't be my responsibility! How uncomfortable will my 2 1/2 hour flight be now?!?! Please American Airlines...do your job...don't make passengers do it for you!!!"
Fly any other airline: The manager's actions today 11:30am April 30th 2021 at American Airlines ticketing in San Diego (SAN) solidified we will NEVER be flying AA again. She was blatantly incorrect about an active duty military pet policy. She called two superiors and both quickly confirmed I was 100% correct. She refused to acknowledge us again and we were forced back in line. Customers around us were just as shocked as we were as she walked away in the wrong.
"Wait, 1 and half star?  I think I'll need more Dramamine after reading all the negative reviews.  Of course, I can't help but to side with my fellow Yelp Elites but with that being said; I'll start my review with 5 stars.  Checking in went through smoothly and the $25 luggage fee (1 luggage)  wasn't too expensive.  Boarding was organized and quick.  Sweet plane with good size TV and close enough to my face.  Plane left on time and I am loving my adjustable head rest.  All I can really ask for is to fly safely and land gracefully."
"First of all, let's start off by saying that I got to my destination alive and that is the most important thing. Aside from that, the configuration on the American planes are very tight. You are really crammed in there. The seats in some rows were stuck in the recline position,  meaning they are broken. In general, the cosmetics of the interior look to be in mediocre condition. I will always choose Southwest before American, but in this case it made more financial sense to go American."
"My husband and I used our miles to book tickets to Greece for our Honeymoon. Although we purchased the tickets separately, I selected seats in advance so we could sit next to each other. Upon check-in, we were very disappointed to see that somehow our seats had been changed and we were no longer near each other for the 11-hour international flight. I explained this to the AA representative, requesting to be relocated next to each other. We were told to wait and were passed off to another AA representative at the boarding gate, who in a very condescending tone told us ""yes... but you're going to have to pay for it."" We were super insulted and off-put by the customer service exchange that we decided not to pay over $100 per ticket to get seats next to each other when we had originally booked adjoining seats. Not only was this our honeymoon, but my husband recently opened an AA credit card and this was our first experience back with American Airlines since COVID. It was incredibly disappointing."
Flight attendant ramming my knee with a drink cart and not apologizing. Extremely rude gate agents. Mishandled and damaged luggage...and most recently not helping my pregnant wife move her seat from a window to an aisle. This 1 star is long overdue for AA. Hot tip: It's not that hard to figure out the CEO's email address ;-) ;-) Hopefully it you figure it out you'll get for then the BS courtesy call that I got.

"Very deceptive airlines with condescending employees. I booked my ticket with air miles and unknown to me.. apparently there is a basic economy ticket. This basic airline ticket has an American Airlines price tag with a spirit airlines business motto (you pay for everything!) if it doesn't fit under your seat, thenIt's $25 for overhead space. Well, I didn't know this and I get to the gate.. and now it's $50 to check a bag!! I questioned it and the employees were rude and very "" you should know better."" I will try to avoid flying with American Airlines.. I rather pay half the price and fly with spirit and expect the extra charges."
One stars just because the plane didn't fall out of the sky. They delayed my partner for 15 hours in an airport with no help and no alternative routes out. We had to figure it out ourselves. 500$ ticket so we could have an early arrival down the drain. I would've been fine with a just even a 100$ discount for the inconvenience but they laughed me off the phone for asking. Never flying AA again. Completely unhelpful. Covid packed flights.
This airline does not care about the safety of their staff or customers just the headline. Y'all evil for letting that man harass the attendants and punishing them for keeping the flight safe. I would never give my mone to a company who said I don't care they drunk harassed and groped a team member. Trash company.
Our American Airlines Check-in desk in San Diego are so Rude and aggressive with the customers
Called to change my ticket and after waiting 2 hours for a call back I got scolded for not having my ticket info ready and was transferred to the end of call survey without changing my flight. Now I have to wait another 2 hours which will be past my new flight time so I have to spend another $300-400 to stay another night. People who work as customer service representative have to like people and want to help them. The person I talked to was very rude and did not want to help me. Bad management decision to hire this person in this position. Will try to not fly American Airline ever again and will let everyone I know on social media know too.
Terrible terrible terrible terrible!!! Avoid flying this airline and the SD location at all costs! Worst customer service at the San Diego airport! I arrived on time to check a bag and was told i cannot check because it was full. They had no other flights and would not give me a refund for a 500 dollar flight. Also 'supervisor' on duty was extremely rude and told me there's nothing she can do. Absolutely horrendous! Never again. I will continue to give bad reviews as well. Avoid!!!!
"Worst airline ever. I wish I could tell you how inconsiderate customer service was. To start, they cancelled my flight from the US to London and did not notify me or my family (who was traveling with me). I did not find out until 24 hrs before when I attempted to check in. This would mean I would miss my connection flight to Jordan. THEN after HOURS of calling and waiting on hold at about 1 am they booked us a flight at 9am. Of course, we had scheduled our covid tests 72 before flight and we were still waiting for results. If our flight was at its regular time (7pm) we would have had our results. Because it was moved way earlier, we did not have our results and could not take the flight. FURTHERMORE, the 2 ladies who were at customer service were both rude. Separately. One had me fill out online applications  for about 30 min (that I had already done for the cancelled flight) and then did not look at them. The other was just flat out RUDE I can't explain. Everything a person could do to make things more difficult ~ she did ~ 0/5"
American Airlines stranded me in Europe.   They cancelled a flight I had booked with miles and stated that no other flights were available to rebook.  I had to buy a one way ticket last minute from Geneva to San Diego.
They no longer have customer service. Hours long holding times.  Website is dysfunctional. Can't accommodate change of flights of individual travelers. Look forward to their bankruptcy.
"Today 12/28 American announced plans to place the notorious 737 Max planes in service.Last week, Air Canada experienced engine failure issues that required an emergency landing.BEWARE...DO NOT FLY THESE PLANES. They are unsafe by design and the FAA and airlines all know it."

"American Airlines used to be one of my favorite airlines to fly with.  However recently their customer service has really gone down hill.  I booked 3 flights with them over seas and then upgraded to first class.  All was well, then I had to change my flight due to covid to a later date.  They refused to transfer my first class seats for the exact same flights at a later date.  They made me jump through hoops to talk to the right people which I never really got to talk to.  They all kept blaming a different department. Saying they could not help me.  In the end they made me go back into couch and they gave me a credit for what I originally paid for my upgrade and told me if I wanted to upgrade on this new flight I could pay 1400 for each person.  INSANE!  I also had 3 additional flights with them I have since canceled or changed due to them constantly changing flight times.  If you can help it I would fly with a different airline at this time."
"Aa does not fail to fail. The last time I was here they had one gate agent when the day started at 5am. The line was around the terminal. Today was the first time that my Husky roller was confiscated.  Nobody else challenged its ability to fit in the overhead.  Not Charlotte, Dallas,  Chicago, Boston, BWI etc. The agents were not rude, but they had a heavy Barney Fife / DMV vibe. The 5 am pic is attached."
"Word of warning...your carryon bag must be smaller than the posted measurements.  I was stopped at the gate today because my bag did not fit completely INSIDE the white lines not AT the limits of the white lines.  Funny how I've traveled many times on many airlines with this exact Samsonite bag.  If I wanted to check a bag, I would have done so with a bag that doesn't meet the size limitations.Delta- I'm begging you to provide more flights from PHX.  I want to continue being a loyal customer to you but American and Southwest dominates my city.Maybe it's worth paying more money to have a better experience."
The AA ticket counter at San Diego Airport might have the worst nasty disrespectful ugly employe work at this ticket counter. He is old white man in his 60 with white hair with a nasty attitude that will do whatever he can to make your life miserable. He treated me with a 3 month old like crazy just because he thought the baby's stroller was too big. Idiot. We missed the flight seating there explaining to him. Stay away from that nasty man and pick a diffrent agent next time.
"Called today to inquire why my flight is non-refundable 50 days out.... Wait time was over four hours so I opted for a return phone call. No refunds from American Airline in these still difficult travel times.... United, Alaskan, and  Southwest are all still giving refund to try and help customers out."
"Can never open this app without resetting the password which involves countless delays.  My suit bag, I was told I had to check even though there are countless spaces including the coat area at the front of the plane.  Delayed flight naturally (it's sunny across the USA) and no help from the front desk"
"DONNA WILSON a very rude and disrespectful customer service rep.Today 8/29- I asked her if she can seat me and my travel buddies together.  Immediately she responded with attitude . Here's her response, I HAVE a family of six and other people ahead of you besides you purchased an economy seats and you can't choose seats. She didn't even ask my boarding pass or at least say hi..   I responded, I am only asking you a question with a yes and no answer not asking you to tell me other customers issue. Why you hired people that don't know how to respect others. She is representing AA with that kind of attitude! This is the first time I  encountered a rep with such horrible attitude.DONNA WILSON you need to behave lady!!!!!!!!! This person don't deserve a star at all."
"There is a guy here checking people in as they board who is beyond awful. So minus like a zillion stars for that guy. I saw him being rude to many people in line and if I see him again I will get his name and put him on blast. I know it sucks to deal with people all day, but if you can't do it then quit because there is a line of people ready to take your job! It really hurts the energy of everyone going on the flight and makes it even more miserable. Phew!Other then that this is an airline much like any other. I dig that you can save enough points to cover a flight pretty fast, and that they have a lot of options. The in flight service varies but I usually never have a problem. Much to Camilla the Yelping Hen's horror they count her as a ""bag."" So before we board I have to stuff her in my backpack. Then I have to deal with an upset hen all the rest of the journey. Makes 4 year olds look like angels on a flight...Seriously though when you fly with AA you are usually going to have a solid flight. Sometimes if they like you then you get free wine. Watch for the half bottles they offer on longer flights. Go ahead and judge but I need my medicine especially with an irate hen clucking up a storm. It is sorta sad that this airline lacks charm. If I ever have a choice this one is not at the top."
Horrible service i got from American Airlines they ripped my luggage and just. Said they would not be responsible because i had a conection with another carrier but i clearly saw my luggage ripped when i switched planes
This Airline broke my luggage and refuses to reimburse me i can't tell you how upset i am with this company very shady business
Worst airline company ever destroyed my suitcase and never refund me on 1300 dollars i spent customer service ignored my claim never using this company ever again
"So upon arriving at the airport I was told by the united attendant that I could not carry on my bag because I had bought a low cost ticket even though it was the size of a carry-on. OK I say, I'll just fly Southwest next time. From that point on the attendant continue to tell me how many different airlines I could've chosen other than hers. She's right I won't fly United again. Thanks dingbat.  And look at the rest of the reviews people United airlines you're pathetic."
