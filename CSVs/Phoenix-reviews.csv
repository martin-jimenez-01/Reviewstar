"I departed from here to head back to Atlanta for a month. From the Counter Agents (while declaring certain items) to the Gate Agent & Flight Crew, it was a positive experience overall. A special acknowledgment to Ms. Andrea who escorted me to TSA Screening, with her refreshing customer service. Although airborne, Flight Crew # 462 on 9/24 serviced well...a step up from my last couple of flights with AA.AA is located at Terminal 4."
Our flight got delayed for Los Angeles to Phoenix. We were told to go get rebooked at another gate. It was under construction and accessible. After struggling to find my way up stairs with my bag I was told they'd changed the departure and we were actually boarding. I had to rush back to the gate about a 10-15 minute journey. When we arrived in Phoenix other passengers were offered to ride in a cart (several of which appeared perfectly able bodied). I was walking with a cane and only had 10 minutes to get what their app explained was a 15 minutes walk. When I got to the gate the crew rushed us onto the flight even though I had stopped to use my inhaler. I do not understand why the airport would not offer to help a woman carrying a backpack walking with a cane assistance and then be impatient during a breathing emergency. Also there were many open seats on the flight I can't believe the overhead bins were full and they HAD to check my carryon.
"If it were up to me, this airline would dissolve it's business into a much more professional and accommodating airline like United or Southwest.LOCATION:Pretty much every major airport in the US.DECOR:Planes are on par with most other airlines as far as look and amenities. They have their fancy planes and their A to B planes.PRICE:Depends on the site, time of year, destination, length of time searching and amount of websites visited.DRINKS:Usual airline coffee, canned sodas and beverages and alcohol.FOOD:Nuts and basic snacks to order. Longer flights offer bigger meals like a bagged chicken dinner or usually beef. Neither are much better than TV dinners at home.STAFF:I feel bad for them. They have to work at an airline that doesn't treat it's employees well enough for them to care about the passengers they are intended to help. They are usually coarse, upset about overbooked flights which happens on the regular and impersonal. Overbooking is actually part of the airline's strategy to not have any unsold seats on a plane. That's great for making money for their stockholders, but it's a shit way to treat customers.EXPERIENCE:This is based on my last experience with American airlines who have lived up to their reputation as an airline who doesn't care for their passengers.My partner used miles for us to fly to the Midwest and had enough for first class on the longer connection. Upon switching planes for our 9pm flight, we were told there was a delay for weather, but there was no inclement weather. 2 answerless hours go by and every passenger is at the gate counter demanding answers. Finally, we hear that the crew was just tired from another flight they were coming in on. Then we were told we could rebook at the counter and receive meal vouchers, so... 1. We're at the counter and we can't rebook for first class.2. They won't refund our miles.3. There are no more flights for the night so we have to stay in a hotel of their choosing.4. Every restaurant is closed so we can't use our meal vouchers until the morning.5. The meal vouchers are for $12 per person at the airport!6. Employees showed little to no empathy and provided infuriating answers to concerns like ""that's just the way AA does it and there's nothing we can do about it."" ""You'll have to step to the end of the line and wait again or call the (unresponsive) help desk."""
"Since there was no direct flight from Las Vegas to San Diego on American Airlines, I had to fly to Phoenix, Arizona in order to catch a flight to San Diego. It wasn't too bad because I spent my time in the Centurion Lounge which was a good stay. I just thought the couple hours layover in Phoenix, which is the opposite direction was quirky but I guess I understand.I flew first class which was great and the stewardess was very attentive to all of us. We got our drinks, mixed nuts and had an enjoyable short flight. As usual, the seats were very comfortable and there was a lot of leg room for everybody, which for me who only stands at 5'4"" was a lot of legroom!Definitely no complaints from the time we boarded, seated and landed. It was a very smooth flight. I definitely suggest flying first class even on short flights  just due to the leg room, comfortability and complimentary drinks!"
"On a round trip I scheduled/paid for a few months beforehand: the trip to CA ONT from AZ PHX was meh, with the attendants missing my isle twice and the person next to me loudly complaining about it the rest of the (thankfully) short trip. The way back I couldn't figure out if my flight was still happening/it's status without going to the airport (no one was answering the phones and the website was worthless) through security and waiting at (what was hopefully still) my gate for an attendant to arrive and confirm my flight was still happening or if I even had a seat. Then the actual flight back they forgot my row again but I didn't really notice from how irritated I was at trying to sleep with somebody kicking the back of my seat (I didn't blame the other passengers as he was just a few grown man shifting his frame around in a seat designed for a 10 year olds body mass and leg length)"
"Seems as though the industry Has home from hospitality and travel to money grubbing. Checked in about trying to get an exit row for 2.5 hour flight and to upgrade to an exit row (challenges of being over 6'6"") was doing to be almost half the cost of the ticket itself. It's a fascinating problem when the process or being asked to assist in case of emergency, and then being charged an excessive fee on top of that. They've lost me as a customer."
"I had a layover here with American. I can only speak to the employees at this terminal. The gate attendant was worn a bit thin, but had a rapport with the customers that was amazing and was able to diffuse some spats that were starting. I have no idea what her name was, but whoever was working the gate on February 25, 2021 for the flight from Phoenix, AZ to Portland, OR should be promoted.Anywho. The layover went smoothly. The disembarking from one flight and boarding of the other went well. This is a great example of how things should flow. Well and with communication. This terminal is something else and needs a lot of work, but that is on the airport, not the airline."
"Never experienced this many flight delays! Crew staffing, maintenance items and always some reason for the delay. Over 9 changes in flight times and multiple delays in one day!"
"I love traveling via American Airlines. I always have the best experiences with flight arrival and departure times. The attendants are always helpful and friendly.  I would suggest you arrive on time otherwise the pilot will take off without you. Lol, happy travels"
"We all have choices!! I am over and done with their horrible customer service. Was told by agent and supervisor, ""David Ortega"" that there is nothing they can do for me. Not even an empathetic apology for not being able to help.I hope this resinates with people making a decision on who to fly with and they choose anyone but American Airlines!!!"
"One of worst Airlines in the world, but we all already know that. Your best bet is to eat and pack the Cana-Candy and have a mental escape from the torture in the terminal with the rude staff. I hope another airline does a corporates hostile takeover!!!!"
"We always prefer to fly American. Never had an instance of bad staffing. Planes are typically clean and given we have the AA card, we have access to their lounges which is a great escape from the typical airport crowds. WiFi available during flight via the AA site so you can watch movies or play games on your phone from their inflight selections."
"what would you do if you used this airline to fly from Michigan to arizona with your dog. Only to be told by tje obviously inexperienced counter girl that your dog is too big to fly back home to michigan. Cancelling your flight without refund. Causing you to be where you are for another 2 days.... If the dog flew from michigan to arizona, it should be able to fly home back to michigan....   Do better..  or train better. Either way. Its a mess that didnt need to happen."
"American Airlines check in attendant Brenda at Phoenix airport terminal 4 gate A07 gets the top award for being the most rude airline rep I've ever encountered in 20 years of flying. I asked for assistance getting on the plane after having a painful surgery with visible stitches and she tried to make me pay for an upgraded seat which wasn't my intention, THEN proceeded to tell me my airport gift bag I was holding needed to be packed or checked.. it literally had a Bible in it.... I shoved it in my bag and took it out 3feet from her hoping she'd see. I wasn't aware American Airlines employed miserable heartless employees. I'm thankful 4 passengers helped me :)"
"Same bs company, different day... we were booked for the longest time at a certain time. We show up and they had the doors locked on 4 other passengers including us....The time was set at 9:30PM. We show up at 9:24 on the dot and the doors were already closed and they couldn't reopen them bc of some bs where they had already started their safety meeting...Had no choice as that was the only company that flew from the closest airport to PHX... but again, now I learned my lesson. Never ever again!Worse customer service ever... all the ladies at the door had to do was just call the cabin and let them know that the passenger who were booked are here... bet you instead they overcharged other people and sold them out seat...  now we're rebooked the following day on standby... bc we are not even sure we can get on that one...Definitely not a company you really want to choose as your first choice."
"The most bullshit company airline ever! If you can, avoid at all cost!!This stupid company sells their ticket to you and is happy taking your money upfront. And then what they do after is when you purchased one of their economy tickets, try to pray on those people to try to sell them any possible upgrades from first class, to emergency seats to just different seat to get a few extra dollars out of your flight.I looked at one of the seats that they were selling and it just so happen, the seat is literally same row window seat, but on the other side and they wanted to charge an extra $7 for it.The new thing is their stupid class 9 boarding, which if you check in late enough, their website won't let you check in and forces you to agree to a one bag under the seat only and no carry on... and then they tell you to take your bad to the check in. Once you get to the check in, they will lock the bag Check in because then it would already be $25 per bag. But because you can't check it in, you take it all the way to the gate and then it's a $50 charge just to check in one bag. And they they give you some bull shit that it's per rule policy and they are really strict about it. Come to find out, I walk on the plane, it is half empty, there are plenty of space on the over head and everyone is just acting as if nothing happen but yet, very happy to charge you at the gate and doubling the feeOverall, this company deserves a 0/5 stars for their stupid made up bulls***t rules that are just made up as you go. Corporate greed has its hands all over this crap. The thing is, I bought these plane tickets for a 4 days round trip special and it didn't even happen on the way there. And I tried to explain that to those people in the front who just again no brain, just do as you're told. I will never fly American airline again. And I'm a frequent flier with many airlines. All you flyers beware!"
"It's all about money for AA. My international flight got cancelled last minute for a maintenance issue (would rather be safe than sorry) and my family were given a voucher for a beyond disgusting hotel, $12 food voucher for which didn't even cover a single meal at the airport. We had to pay for transportation to and from the airport and completely for dinner, I had to pay for more than half of the breakfast the next day because we had to stay the night. We are out more money than what the vouchers even covered because of this cancellation. With regards to rebooking us, I was separated from my parents on two completely different flights. I understand the staff were put in a very stressful situation, but I would like to fly internationally with my family in the seats that we paid extra for to be together. The staff was very unapologetic and did not put much effort to try and get us all flying together. We took matters into our own hands with customer service on the phone, once at the gross hotel, how to make it possible for us three to fly together and figured out a route- multiple routes. This could have been done for us at the terminal and was not. As a result of this cancellation we are still being charged for our hotel at the destination for the night missed. On Southwest, in a situation similar to this, I've been give more than generous voucher options.update: We finally arrived at our destination, over a day later than expected with all of our luggage missing. Beyond disappointed with American Airlines. I am moving to my destination and thus all of my clothes and belongings are missing with my luggage."
"The majority of the stewardesses were warm and friendly, but not this one woman who insisted that i just needed to get on the plane and was certainly not interested in what I needed as a person with a disability. (I HAD made prior arrangements for ADA service- it didn't work with this woman, however!) This woman was a stewardess on the Philadelphia to Phoenix leg of my trip and missed her calling as a rusted out brillo pad! I don't believe that I may fly American Airlines again- it's certainly not worth getting your belongings going to more places than you do!"
"If there was a way to give American Airlines zero stars I would do it.  After 20 years of flying more than 100,000 miles each and every year on this garbage airline, tonight is the night that I have decided enough is enough. The problem with this airline is not that it has delays and other issues. The problem is that no one at American owns what a failure American Airlines is. No one attempts to do anything about the colossal failures, and it's customers suffer as a result.Tonight I was supposed to take a direct flight from Phoenix to Nashville.  The flight was originally scheduled to leave at 6:45pm - But by 8 AM American had already made the departure time a ""late"" 7:15pm. Well, 7:15 pm would've been fine. But the first plane they put us on didn't takeoff because the maintenance logs were screwed up. The second plane they put us on sat on the runway for an hour with maintenance issues until the pilots timed out and were unable to fly. Not one time did anyone sincerely apologize for this absolute mess. I heard from gate agents that this ""happens all the time.""  I heard from a pilot that he couldn't wait to retire from American's poor performance.  I heard agreement from the entire flight crew that American Airlines was a bottom of the barrel airline. But I didn't hear one person say ""this is wrong and here's what we're going to do to make sure that it doesn't happen again, And by the way we are sorry and here's what we're going to do to take care of you our customer.""  No, American Airlines wouldn't dream of taking responsibility or ownership for the mess that it is and the problems that it causes others.As a frequent flyer with airlines one earn ""status"" and supposed perks. As ""Executive Platinum"" with American for the last 20 years one of those perks is a special phone number I can call to get assistance with problem. Well ... that's really nice. But guess what?  This special line DOES NOT WORK!  I called it 15 times last night and waited 2 hours for a call back!! And when American's dumb shit computer finally called me back THERE WAS NO ONE ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE!!So, enough. I am transferring my loyalty to United Airlines. It will mean more connections. But I'll take five connections over sitting at the airport for five hours and getting nowhere. Experience today was ridiculous, and American has had not one word to say to me about its poor performance.  United doesn't always get it right, and United is not without problems.  But when United has a problem, it is my experience that they own the problem, they apologize for the problem, and they have empowered their employees to make it right. Sounds worthy of loyalty.  So from here on out, they will have mine."
This is the most terrible company I have a metAmerican Airlines always late in the flights the airplane never clean and smell goodI'm not recommend to do business with this Mickey Mouse company
"I'm so mad at American Airlines. Truly-Southwest is the only airlines that cares about their passengers. I flew Santa Barbara to Phoenix with two bags-gate checked one and carried one on. First off-the flight board st the airport said flight was delayed 90 minutes so I walked 15 minutes away to get food. The board remained to show the delay. Thankfully a friend texted me that it was in time. The board still showed delayed. So I called American out of courtesy to let them know. I also stopped at their customer service desk-out of courtesy. They finally changed the board-20 minutes prior to the flight.  I hope nobody missed the flight. Then, while Boarding my connection-the agent insisted my bag was too big-I put it in the little guide that shows if it fits or not. It fit just fine. She insisted that I check it. She wouldn't even let me hate check it.  She was just RUDE. I even showed her that when I take the pillow and blanket out that it's really small. Why are sone people such prudes. Isn't it enough that traveling is already difficult?Truly frustrating. btw-I've flown with that sane bag on board at least a hundred times. She just wanted to give me a hard time."
Start your review of American Airlines.
"They left on time and got us to our destination 30 minutes early. The plane seats were comfortable.  The landing was smooth.          The things that kept it from being 5 star is they didnt have the ATeam at the check in desk. Luckily we arrived early so not stressed about missing the plane. Maybe they are new and learning but it was REALLY slow. The line wasnt moving, and some people started just bypassing the line and going to the front. None of the employees addressed that.  The staff were nice but wow need more people at check in especially if moving so slow.          Was very disappointed didnt get to watch movie on the plane. They dont have screens for movies .  You have to use your device .  I only had a phone with me so downloaded the American airline app.  My husband is much more techie and he worked for 30 minutes to try and get my phone to play a movie. His tablet did fine. But not having something to distract me made the flight seem long    . In all fairness anyone who knows me can attest that i am cursed ... anything electronic or technology. We are used to the seat in front having a screen on the back of it that would have been great."
"This airline is straight garbage. Never have any issues when I fly Delta. But the few times I have flown American, there is always an issue. I've been deplaned a couple of times and the flights seem to never be on time. Avoid at all costs."
Absolutely worst value for your money and seats are incredibly uncomfortable. You are treated like cattle. Its terrible.
Terrible. They oversell flights and then make people wait over an hour as the negotiate with people to give up their seats with ZERO regard or respect to the passengers affected who paid.
"The gate 23 flight to Phoenix from Austin agent was MEAN, RUDE and ANGRY. PLUS, not consistent. I wonder if it is because that I am not white. I can't believe this still goes on. People were boarding with over sized luggage. They were white. She saw me take my purse out of my mini backpack to get my medicine. BUT YELLED AT ME TO GET OUT OF MY PAID FIRST CLASS SEAT AND INTO THE OTHER LINE WHILE I STUCK IT IN MY BACKPACK. I should of gone w the disability folks because I had major surgery and can't carry over ten pounds. The agent said that she puts her purse in her backpack. She was laughing and enjoying being unkind, rude and mean. Many people told me it was because they hate first class people. I think they hate non whites. Just saying."
"My citi card application and acceptance has been the worst experience possible. If I knew it would be like this I would have never applied. Having to talk to customer service three different times on the phone just to get my application approved because the citi application process glitched leaving me in limbo for weeks. Then I get told that I am approved to expect my new card. On the day that I'm supposed to get my new card I just get a notice from citi bank saying that they need more information and provided another application number and reference id... I already had done this two weeks prior where you go online and enter the reference id. What is ridiculous is that it didn't have me enter any additional information, it just said that is all we need after the id was entered. This whole process has been a complete waste of my time. What is truly unfortunate and unfair to me is that I was going through all of this so that I could use my card for upcoming travel and because citi took months to even process my application I couldn't use the card on my travel and missed out on the American airline points that I got this card for. Seriously has been such a pain. Not only that, but since I waited extra days to book the flights due to the promises from the phone citi agent that my new card would arrive I ended up paying an extra $160 for my tickets all while still not being able to use my card. You really need to get your stuff together because no one should go through this."
"Shittest airline company ever, my flights got delayed multiple times already (8+ hours) as I am writing this review, and may not be the end of it. gate numbers always changing you have to constantly checking to make sure. It was a nightmare to flight with American Airlines, I saw many many groups of people also experiencing the same thing.For a 1300 domestic flight, this is a joke, they need to go back to beta testing before rolling out their service to the public."
Is there a reason why the lady doing the boarding is not calling anything by sections etc? She just keeps switching the screens?Is there a reason why u dont call priority boarding for military?
"I am beginning to like American Airlines more and more. My last few flights have been on time, I love the priority boarding and first free bag policy when you book with their credit card. The seats are comfortable and lately the staff has been nicer. American has improved!"
"Flew 1st class from Tulsa to Phoenix.   It was a waste of money.   They didn't have enough meals for everyone (meals included).   The attendant would leave the area and we couldn't get drinks (included in the price).   No pre-take off drinks.    I'm not trying to sound like a snob, but I paid nearly double for a first class ticket and these items are supposed to be included, at least that's what they told me. Luckily I had purchased some snacks before boarding.  I pull the tray out and it was filthy and sticky."
"Monday I show up for a flight from Phoenix to Norfolk Virginia. After a couple hours of sitting on the tarmac they decided the airplane was now air worthy. Tuesday I show up for the same flight and same story. This time the engine would not startI went to customer service immediately to request my suitcase. They said no problem it will be on carousel 5 in 30 minutes to two hours.  I waited an hour and went to ask again for status. They told me "" sorry your bag is going on another plane to Norfolk but we will get Norfolk to send it back and it will be delivered to your home tomorrow by 4. "".   Wednesday at 7 I called to say that it was past 4 and no suitcase.  They said "" right, it is in Norfolk"". I asked why it wasn't shipped to me as promised. They had no answer. Finally today it was sent back to me. Having lost all confidence in the competency of American Airlines I drove to the airport to retrieve my suitcase rather than let their delivery service lose my suitcase. To recap two busted airplanes 5 round trips to the airport over 4 days  lost suitcase for 3 days.  Apologies?  None.  Find a real airline and skip Awful Airlines"
"My first flight of the day was terrible. The entire flight crew was in a bad mood and acted as if the passengers were responsible. One of the elite crew was so consumed with flirting with a passenger with Rochmonaf (sic) Concert #3 music on his lap, she leaned into him and her back end was 2"" from my face! She did not close the bathroom door and let out a scream when it banged open during takeoff. She did not know the caption turned off the seatbelt sign when we had been parked for at least two minutes.I hope they rest up and try again."
"So far not digging the AA experience at PHX International. The majority of the seats at gate A5 are super dirty, the gate agents were busy talking about how badly they were being treated regarding the number of departures - I remember not long ago you were complaining because no one was traveling - the agents at the entry point on the first floor were rude. I know you're in a stressful industry and you deal with all types, but not everyone is the person you just dealt with.Added note - please turn up the speakers at gate A5 or ask the gate attendant to speak up. Worse than trying to hear Charlie Brown's teacher"
Would give zero stars if I could.  Mechanical issues prevented same day departure in Austin Tx.  Got rerouted for next day without telling me. Didn't get me to my destination until 10 hrs late then over an hour late home having to having the plane go back to the gate to get sign off on maintenance to leave again. Home in middle of the night.  American is worst Airline ever.  Also horrible and uncaring    Last flight with them ever.  Idiots.
"We have been flying with American for a very long time.  We just flew on Monday for the first time in 3 years due to the pandemic.   Everyone was wonderful, kind and helpful.   The flight was smooth, the food and drink excellent and we want to compliment Michael and Michelle who took care of us the entire flight.  Very engaging, kind and friendly.  Our flight was a direct to Kona, HI.   After all of the stories we have read the past few years we were so grateful that there were no ""karens"" on board which made for a most pleasant experience."
Terrible airline.  Day 3 crossing the country.  First flight of the day.  No flight attendants.  First flight. Beautiful weather. No excuse.  Supervisor told me flight attendant sick out over COVID vaccine policy.
"I can't give zero stars, but PHX deserves it! This time the cavalier attitude of the gate staff caused an inappropriate level of confusion...even for me who flys weekly on AA! I've said it before and I'll say it again...someone needs to do something about the overall attitude and very poor attention to Elite AAdvantage members. As I had no other option for this trip, I hoped for the best and PHX once again lives up to the lack of any standard. AA should be embarrassed!"
"Once again, the operations for AA and the employees at PHX are NOT what AA is all about. Once again, PHX has again confirmed to be the worst airport in the USA for AA. Not only did we land early, we parked for almost 30 minutes because of ""traffic"" and arrived late! What traffic?!? As I only had 40 minutes to make my connection to LAX, it was now down to 30 minutes because of this mis-management. And as ALWAYS, I arrived in the furthest A concourse and needed to make it to the furthest gate in the furthest concourse...B25! This ALWAYS happen at PHX! My last trip through PHX which I rewarded with 1 star, this exact scenario happened and I told myself I'll fly to DFW and come back west! Or AA after this trip nonsense, it's time to do as I said which was Doug Parker needs to change all of this!"
"PHX is absolutely the worst airport in the entire AA network! The total disregard for Elite Advantage members not only at the gate, but also in the Admirals Club is beyond insulting! As I don't have much of a choice to travel to LAX from NorCal until the Eagle flights return, I may just fly to DFW and come back west!Not that social distancing is a concern  personally, but the total mismanagement at the gate never changes! The rudeness exhibited to all customers is reprehensible and needs to be corrected. Much of this could clearly be resolved by hiring people that can manage the traveling public that does not travel by air frequently. I will now be looking to fly out of the way through DFW even to come back west for a short trip to totally avoid PHX! Doug Parker...you should do something about this in the name of what is proper and AA!!!"
The absolute WORST airline ever. They have single handily ruined my vacation. I will never fly with them ever again. AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS
Worst airlines ever. Staff are rude as hell. They gave our 1st class seats away. Managers have no authority. Gate personnel are poorly trained
Terrible customer service and the service in Miami was so discriminatory and rude to my handicapped father that we will never fly on this airline
"Paid to upgrade to premium seats so we'd have more legroom. Chose a window and the middle seat next to it.  Got confirmation of the selections.  Payment of $45 each went through.  Then we find out they changed us to an aisle and a middle seat without telling us.  Not what we wanted or paid for.  When I contacted American, they could not explain why.  They just told me the two seats we had paid for and were confirmed with were no longer available.  No offer to refund the money or move us back to the seats we booked.  Don't waste your money upgrading seats."
Start your review of American Airlines.
Travelled in AA for the first time ever for our trip from phoenix to Hawaii. They are on terminal 4 of phoenix which is old one and hence not very appealing airport as such.Service was bad for the checkin and baggage. I was supposed to get free checked bag since i have their citi mastercard but for some reason system gave me free but not for my companion wife. This is not as per terms of the credit card membership. Attendee had to call manager too but he couldn't fix it even after acknowledging that bags should have been free. Instead he asked me to pay for now and contact credit card company. Manager should atleast have some access to override mistakes in system or probably manager didn't tried it properly. Even their flights didn't had seat screen for 6+ hour of long journey. Would not prefer this airline in future for sure. I guess we are addicted to delta now.
American Airlines overbooked our flight. They are booting one of girls off the flight because she booked early and paid less. Picking and choose who to kick off. NOT HAPPY WITH THEM
"I absolutely love American Airlines first time riding phoenix to La I on flight numb . Aa2054 on 2/22 , a check is n person named Jessica was a ""karen"" tonight, I probably have 1k plus flights with them not including kids etc. And this (woman of Caucasian non color) was harassing passengers, the man boarding b4 me paid to board on priority and she sent away to ticket booth, I was boarding group 4 and she said ohh how many people do u have I said 1 she said ohh you need need to check luggage , I said no I don't, another lady came and said "" hun you need to consolidate  your Fannie pack , I said seriously, lol no prob, did it n hopped on the plane, wtf!!! Weirdo ass bitches .. I'm a ""professional flyer"" I'm trynna get on get off simple as possible, these weirdo ass bitches where literally on sum weirdo shit, this is my first complaint ever for American Airlines only bc they need to check these ""bitches"" otherwise I luv this Airlines!!!!!"
"I've always had great experiences with this airline. The staff I have interacted with have been kind and helpful. My only complaint is how cramped the seats are but other than that, this airline has been really good to me."
Everytime I fly American Airlines I always get stuck at the airport for connecting flights as they won't wait 1 minute for the connecting plane! In fact they purposely leave early.Thank God I don't have any.more miles to use.Already cancelled my credit card with them 2 years ago but had to use up my air miles this year.Does AA stand for AWFUL AIRLINES??JC
"After over 20 years of loyal AA Advantage credit card and miles program I am cancelling. American Airlines offers the worst customer experience.  Their flights are always delayed. They rig the mileage program with blocked seats and overcharge miles Their staff is numb to the urgency of travelers and has become deaf to the cacophony of complaints that, by now, have become white noise to them.I will spend the rest of my life preaching to anyone who will listen, how bad they are."
"The worst Travel experience ever!Had to wait 4 hours delay in L.A. on the way out and on the way back a total nail-biting crunch as the gates changing constantly while I was in the air.  My first connection was moved to a different terminal all together barely made it on the slow bus to the hinterlands.Had to literally sprint thru the Phoenix Airport to get to my gate...not bad for a 70 year old woman wearing 2 masks and a 20 lb. Backpack .  Unfortunately, someone plopped in my aisle seat and refused to move.  Decided not to argue because it certainly fit with the rest of day.   No help from staff of American, of course, because that might be service!  NEVER AGAIN AMERICAN!"
OH MY GOSH. Pam and Dorthy with AA Cargo are the best. My boyfriend and I are college students who are shipping our dog for the first time for thanksgiving and they were amazing. They were so sweet and made sure to help us every step of the way. Thank you so much Pam and Dorothy! You made our day!
"The flight attendants are always rude and pushy on these flights. I only have kept flying this airline because of the amount of miles I have.  After those are gone so am I because I was so embarrassed today on flight.So when I pick my seat online I pick it towards the window and where there are no other people seated if possible. I am vulnerable to coronavirus and do not try to travel often.I also always make sure to be the last on the airplane so that I can switch seats if it is packed full like sardines.If the plane is like that, and I am the last on the plane I ask to sit in exit rows which have less people that use them because u have to pay more. This has never been a problem before or on any other airline. This flight, The stewardess just looks at me and is like ""that's not your seat you need to go to your seat, people pay extra for these"" and didn't give me a chance to talk at all and I'm a v shy person so after getting literally yelled at, I got up and moved where I'm sitting next to 3x the amount of people half with their nose out of their mask. Kudos to putting dollar signs about public health and safety! (To clarify I've done this on literally every flight beforehand and the stewardesses were very understanding and helpful, there was no need for her to be that rude to me, it hurt my feelings)."
"Crappy A321 outdated airbus flying ACROSS the country with the worst service EVER!! Do NOT fly this flight. The AA gate attendants are rude and don't give a flying you know what about service. Horrible customer service with a FROWN!!My Bf bought me a ""first class"" ticket so I would come back to NY and this is what I got...Old A 321 out dated crappy plane that smells like farts and bad breath with a side of really nasty perfume that the flight attendant was wearing. No outlets for charging your devices No drinks before the long wait to take off No foodNo snacks You have to pay for WiFi @ $16 per device No screens so bring your iPad or computer or Benadryl so you can sleep through this nightmare of a flight RUDE flight attendants who don't want to assist and reprimand passengers for using the bathroom before take off. Unbelievably horrible experience!!"
"If it were possible, American Airlines deserves negative ratings. Unfortunately, the lowest rating is one star. Everyone that I interacted with. from the gate agents through my flights over the last several trips had consistently treated me horribly. I had continued to book flights with American due to cost and convenience. Additionally, I kept hoping for improvement."
"If I could give lower than 1 star I would! I will never fly American Airlines again. What a shit show their software and service is.My team and I were going on a business trip to Illinois. We all upgraded AND PAID for premium seats (to sit next to each other) only to find out that the day before the flight the airline decided to COMPLETELY CHANGE THE SEATS WE PAID FOR!!! None of us are sitting by each other now and our seat preference was completely changed (i.e. row, aisle, exit...You get the point).Beyond that, half the team has TSA pre-check, yet the airline couldn't figure their shit out and put it on the boarding passes. Calling customer service was a four hour wait, talking to the ticket counter was completely pointless as well. Thanks for not helping at all AA!One more fun thing to add, don't even bother asking what is the appropriate line to stand in to check bags, you will get an eye roll and told ""if you aren't priority, then go down there. Not everyone knows where ""down there"" is."
This is related to reservation number ******. American Airlines partners with Citbank.  I applied for the Citi Matstercard on AA Vacation Website to pay for me Vacation.  I was approved for $$$$.  Card is declined.   AA customer service cannot help me as states it is a Citi Bank issue.  I am transferred to Citi.  Citi approved me for $$&& but I am only approved the full amount in 2 weeks when I get some letter.  Until then I am approved for $ (less than reservation costs).   American Airlines Vacations needs to disclose to customers who want to pay for their vacation using a partnered AA citi bank card that they may be approved that day for an amount BUT the full amount is not avail to the customer until 2 weeks.  They will have to use another card and not the AA card.  If they cannot pay for it then reservation will be canceled.The customer needs to know their is no point applying for the card if the full amount will not be availAmerican Airlines has a failed process and customer service has no way to address it other than to cancel my reservation.  This is unacceptable.  I have been sent back and forth between Citi bank and Customer Service America Airlines Vacation.  The Customer Service Representative (CSR) hung up on me because she did not know what to do.
"Just gowd aweful. A total downfall of a once great airline. My flight was delayed 3 hrs, causing me to miss my connection. My new connecting flight had a 4 hr layover and I just fot notice it was delayed 2 hours!!!!!!!!!This airline is a complete shit show"
"I recently flew from New York's JFK airport to Phoenix on American Airlines.  I had just spent 2 1/2 weeks in Ghana, West Africa, and was ill and very tired when I arrived home at Sky Harbor Airport.  Much to my chagrin, my luggage was severely damaged somewhere between JFK through Dallas to Phoenix.  The luggage is so damaged that I will not be able to use the luggage again.  I have flown American Airlines, almost exclusively since my first flight with American in 1970 when I was a high school senior.  And no American did not provide any compensation for the damage.  I can only say I am so disappointed in this kind of treatment."
"The best ticketing agent at American, Su-Shien #247133 was an amazing help to me this past Wednesday. I was late and she still got my luggage checked on time.  Sis did everything in about 30 seconds!  Maybe a raise?  Promotion??"
"If I could have given their reservations team 0 stars, I would have.  They overcharged me the first time I booked my flight.  So I had to call back and was told they had to cancel my booking and start over with a new one.  The 2nd charge came through and they charged me the wrong amount again! I asked to speak with a supervisor.  Supervisor tells me I must be reading my credit card app wrong and that they 100% charged me the correct amount.  She then told me to wait until tomorrow.  When I asked who I could speak with if it was still wrong, she said I should just call the general line again, but there wasn't going to be a need to because it was 100% impossible that I was charged incorrectly twice.Regardless of making one or two mistakes, I found that they lack courtesy and don't know how to provide good guest service.  They might as well have AI bots answering their phones since their agents are either not properly trained or aren't held accountable to any type of standards.Update - It turns out they did not process or request a refund for my 1st incorrect charge.  I now have to submit a formal request for a refund that MAY be approved.  Their excuse? ""This is our process."""
"This will be a short review. Use Southwest. AA flight attendants are older and grumpy. And this airlines doesn't care about you. Cancelled our flight with no compensation and when we did get a flight out they damaged my suitcase and they broke 3 of my husbands golf clubs. And the funny thing is all 3 clubs are different length, sit differently in the bag but all were broke in the same spot. This was done intentionally. This was done on purpose by a hateful AA employee. When you pay $180 in baggage fees I expect some respect from baggage handlers with my property. Several individuals on our flight had multiple carry-on's and nothing was said. One man had a huge backpack, a roller bag, a laptop bag plus a bag of food. He took up a whole overhead bin. I will NEVER fly this airline again. With the $200 in baggage fees, the $400 to repair 3 golf clubs, $200 for a new suitcase and the inconvenience of the cancelled flight which made us pay another $60 in crappy airport meal fees it's not worth it."
"Impossible to give less than One Star but again American Airlines has successfully caused a plane load of passengers to miss their connections due to no gate crew available for a scheduled flight! Absolutely the worst airline. Flight was delay due to ""No Crew"" now Finally landed and now stuck on the plane in sight of the gate due to ""No Ground Crew"""
"Frustrated flyer...Overpromised and underserved. I am not an AA frequent customer, my experience of booking a 4 day trip, to have delays resulting in a 4 day airport tour has left a bad taste.Not any better than any other airline and terribly inconvenient. It's a pandemic, but be better about schedules. This is not a 2 hour hop on hop off tour bus, you have a real responsibility to hold true to what your selling.American Airlines, Apathetic and Careless"
