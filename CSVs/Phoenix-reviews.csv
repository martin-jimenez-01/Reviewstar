"I departed from here to head back to Atlanta for a month. From the Counter Agents (while declaring certain items) to the Gate Agent & Flight Crew, it was a positive experience overall. A special acknowledgment to Ms. Andrea who escorted me to TSA Screening, with her refreshing customer service. Although airborne, Flight Crew # 462 on 9/24 serviced well...a step up from my last couple of flights with AA.AA is located at Terminal 4."
Our flight got delayed for Los Angeles to Phoenix. We were told to go get rebooked at another gate. It was under construction and accessible. After struggling to find my way up stairs with my bag I was told they'd changed the departure and we were actually boarding. I had to rush back to the gate about a 10-15 minute journey. When we arrived in Phoenix other passengers were offered to ride in a cart (several of which appeared perfectly able bodied). I was walking with a cane and only had 10 minutes to get what their app explained was a 15 minutes walk. When I got to the gate the crew rushed us onto the flight even though I had stopped to use my inhaler. I do not understand why the airport would not offer to help a woman carrying a backpack walking with a cane assistance and then be impatient during a breathing emergency. Also there were many open seats on the flight I can't believe the overhead bins were full and they HAD to check my carryon.
"If it were up to me, this airline would dissolve it's business into a much more professional and accommodating airline like United or Southwest.LOCATION:Pretty much every major airport in the US.DECOR:Planes are on par with most other airlines as far as look and amenities. They have their fancy planes and their A to B planes.PRICE:Depends on the site, time of year, destination, length of time searching and amount of websites visited.DRINKS:Usual airline coffee, canned sodas and beverages and alcohol.FOOD:Nuts and basic snacks to order. Longer flights offer bigger meals like a bagged chicken dinner or usually beef. Neither are much better than TV dinners at home.STAFF:I feel bad for them. They have to work at an airline that doesn't treat it's employees well enough for them to care about the passengers they are intended to help. They are usually coarse, upset about overbooked flights which happens on the regular and impersonal. Overbooking is actually part of the airline's strategy to not have any unsold seats on a plane. That's great for making money for their stockholders, but it's a shit way to treat customers.EXPERIENCE:This is based on my last experience with American airlines who have lived up to their reputation as an airline who doesn't care for their passengers.My partner used miles for us to fly to the Midwest and had enough for first class on the longer connection. Upon switching planes for our 9pm flight, we were told there was a delay for weather, but there was no inclement weather. 2 answerless hours go by and every passenger is at the gate counter demanding answers. Finally, we hear that the crew was just tired from another flight they were coming in on. Then we were told we could rebook at the counter and receive meal vouchers, so... 1. We're at the counter and we can't rebook for first class.2. They won't refund our miles.3. There are no more flights for the night so we have to stay in a hotel of their choosing.4. Every restaurant is closed so we can't use our meal vouchers until the morning.5. The meal vouchers are for $12 per person at the airport!6. Employees showed little to no empathy and provided infuriating answers to concerns like ""that's just the way AA does it and there's nothing we can do about it."" ""You'll have to step to the end of the line and wait again or call the (unresponsive) help desk."""
"Since there was no direct flight from Las Vegas to San Diego on American Airlines, I had to fly to Phoenix, Arizona in order to catch a flight to San Diego. It wasn't too bad because I spent my time in the Centurion Lounge which was a good stay. I just thought the couple hours layover in Phoenix, which is the opposite direction was quirky but I guess I understand.I flew first class which was great and the stewardess was very attentive to all of us. We got our drinks, mixed nuts and had an enjoyable short flight. As usual, the seats were very comfortable and there was a lot of leg room for everybody, which for me who only stands at 5'4"" was a lot of legroom!Definitely no complaints from the time we boarded, seated and landed. It was a very smooth flight. I definitely suggest flying first class even on short flights  just due to the leg room, comfortability and complimentary drinks!"
"On a round trip I scheduled/paid for a few months beforehand: the trip to CA ONT from AZ PHX was meh, with the attendants missing my isle twice and the person next to me loudly complaining about it the rest of the (thankfully) short trip. The way back I couldn't figure out if my flight was still happening/it's status without going to the airport (no one was answering the phones and the website was worthless) through security and waiting at (what was hopefully still) my gate for an attendant to arrive and confirm my flight was still happening or if I even had a seat. Then the actual flight back they forgot my row again but I didn't really notice from how irritated I was at trying to sleep with somebody kicking the back of my seat (I didn't blame the other passengers as he was just a few grown man shifting his frame around in a seat designed for a 10 year olds body mass and leg length)"
"Seems as though the industry Has home from hospitality and travel to money grubbing. Checked in about trying to get an exit row for 2.5 hour flight and to upgrade to an exit row (challenges of being over 6'6"") was doing to be almost half the cost of the ticket itself. It's a fascinating problem when the process or being asked to assist in case of emergency, and then being charged an excessive fee on top of that. They've lost me as a customer."
"I had a layover here with American. I can only speak to the employees at this terminal. The gate attendant was worn a bit thin, but had a rapport with the customers that was amazing and was able to diffuse some spats that were starting. I have no idea what her name was, but whoever was working the gate on February 25, 2021 for the flight from Phoenix, AZ to Portland, OR should be promoted.Anywho. The layover went smoothly. The disembarking from one flight and boarding of the other went well. This is a great example of how things should flow. Well and with communication. This terminal is something else and needs a lot of work, but that is on the airport, not the airline."
"Never experienced this many flight delays! Crew staffing, maintenance items and always some reason for the delay. Over 9 changes in flight times and multiple delays in one day!"
"I love traveling via American Airlines. I always have the best experiences with flight arrival and departure times. The attendants are always helpful and friendly.  I would suggest you arrive on time otherwise the pilot will take off without you. Lol, happy travels"
"We all have choices!! I am over and done with their horrible customer service. Was told by agent and supervisor, ""David Ortega"" that there is nothing they can do for me. Not even an empathetic apology for not being able to help.I hope this resinates with people making a decision on who to fly with and they choose anyone but American Airlines!!!"
"One of worst Airlines in the world, but we all already know that. Your best bet is to eat and pack the Cana-Candy and have a mental escape from the torture in the terminal with the rude staff. I hope another airline does a corporates hostile takeover!!!!"
"We always prefer to fly American. Never had an instance of bad staffing. Planes are typically clean and given we have the AA card, we have access to their lounges which is a great escape from the typical airport crowds. WiFi available during flight via the AA site so you can watch movies or play games on your phone from their inflight selections."
"what would you do if you used this airline to fly from Michigan to arizona with your dog. Only to be told by tje obviously inexperienced counter girl that your dog is too big to fly back home to michigan. Cancelling your flight without refund. Causing you to be where you are for another 2 days.... If the dog flew from michigan to arizona, it should be able to fly home back to michigan....   Do better..  or train better. Either way. Its a mess that didnt need to happen."
"American Airlines check in attendant Brenda at Phoenix airport terminal 4 gate A07 gets the top award for being the most rude airline rep I've ever encountered in 20 years of flying. I asked for assistance getting on the plane after having a painful surgery with visible stitches and she tried to make me pay for an upgraded seat which wasn't my intention, THEN proceeded to tell me my airport gift bag I was holding needed to be packed or checked.. it literally had a Bible in it.... I shoved it in my bag and took it out 3feet from her hoping she'd see. I wasn't aware American Airlines employed miserable heartless employees. I'm thankful 4 passengers helped me :)"
"Same bs company, different day... we were booked for the longest time at a certain time. We show up and they had the doors locked on 4 other passengers including us....The time was set at 9:30PM. We show up at 9:24 on the dot and the doors were already closed and they couldn't reopen them bc of some bs where they had already started their safety meeting...Had no choice as that was the only company that flew from the closest airport to PHX... but again, now I learned my lesson. Never ever again!Worse customer service ever... all the ladies at the door had to do was just call the cabin and let them know that the passenger who were booked are here... bet you instead they overcharged other people and sold them out seat...  now we're rebooked the following day on standby... bc we are not even sure we can get on that one...Definitely not a company you really want to choose as your first choice."
"The most bullshit company airline ever! If you can, avoid at all cost!!This stupid company sells their ticket to you and is happy taking your money upfront. And then what they do after is when you purchased one of their economy tickets, try to pray on those people to try to sell them any possible upgrades from first class, to emergency seats to just different seat to get a few extra dollars out of your flight.I looked at one of the seats that they were selling and it just so happen, the seat is literally same row window seat, but on the other side and they wanted to charge an extra $7 for it.The new thing is their stupid class 9 boarding, which if you check in late enough, their website won't let you check in and forces you to agree to a one bag under the seat only and no carry on... and then they tell you to take your bad to the check in. Once you get to the check in, they will lock the bag Check in because then it would already be $25 per bag. But because you can't check it in, you take it all the way to the gate and then it's a $50 charge just to check in one bag. And they they give you some bull shit that it's per rule policy and they are really strict about it. Come to find out, I walk on the plane, it is half empty, there are plenty of space on the over head and everyone is just acting as if nothing happen but yet, very happy to charge you at the gate and doubling the feeOverall, this company deserves a 0/5 stars for their stupid made up bulls***t rules that are just made up as you go. Corporate greed has its hands all over this crap. The thing is, I bought these plane tickets for a 4 days round trip special and it didn't even happen on the way there. And I tried to explain that to those people in the front who just again no brain, just do as you're told. I will never fly American airline again. And I'm a frequent flier with many airlines. All you flyers beware!"
"It's all about money for AA. My international flight got cancelled last minute for a maintenance issue (would rather be safe than sorry) and my family were given a voucher for a beyond disgusting hotel, $12 food voucher for which didn't even cover a single meal at the airport. We had to pay for transportation to and from the airport and completely for dinner, I had to pay for more than half of the breakfast the next day because we had to stay the night. We are out more money than what the vouchers even covered because of this cancellation. With regards to rebooking us, I was separated from my parents on two completely different flights. I understand the staff were put in a very stressful situation, but I would like to fly internationally with my family in the seats that we paid extra for to be together. The staff was very unapologetic and did not put much effort to try and get us all flying together. We took matters into our own hands with customer service on the phone, once at the gross hotel, how to make it possible for us three to fly together and figured out a route- multiple routes. This could have been done for us at the terminal and was not. As a result of this cancellation we are still being charged for our hotel at the destination for the night missed. On Southwest, in a situation similar to this, I've been give more than generous voucher options.update: We finally arrived at our destination, over a day later than expected with all of our luggage missing. Beyond disappointed with American Airlines. I am moving to my destination and thus all of my clothes and belongings are missing with my luggage."
"The majority of the stewardesses were warm and friendly, but not this one woman who insisted that i just needed to get on the plane and was certainly not interested in what I needed as a person with a disability. (I HAD made prior arrangements for ADA service- it didn't work with this woman, however!) This woman was a stewardess on the Philadelphia to Phoenix leg of my trip and missed her calling as a rusted out brillo pad! I don't believe that I may fly American Airlines again- it's certainly not worth getting your belongings going to more places than you do!"
"If there was a way to give American Airlines zero stars I would do it.  After 20 years of flying more than 100,000 miles each and every year on this garbage airline, tonight is the night that I have decided enough is enough. The problem with this airline is not that it has delays and other issues. The problem is that no one at American owns what a failure American Airlines is. No one attempts to do anything about the colossal failures, and it's customers suffer as a result.Tonight I was supposed to take a direct flight from Phoenix to Nashville.  The flight was originally scheduled to leave at 6:45pm - But by 8 AM American had already made the departure time a ""late"" 7:15pm. Well, 7:15 pm would've been fine. But the first plane they put us on didn't takeoff because the maintenance logs were screwed up. The second plane they put us on sat on the runway for an hour with maintenance issues until the pilots timed out and were unable to fly. Not one time did anyone sincerely apologize for this absolute mess. I heard from gate agents that this ""happens all the time.""  I heard from a pilot that he couldn't wait to retire from American's poor performance.  I heard agreement from the entire flight crew that American Airlines was a bottom of the barrel airline. But I didn't hear one person say ""this is wrong and here's what we're going to do to make sure that it doesn't happen again, And by the way we are sorry and here's what we're going to do to take care of you our customer.""  No, American Airlines wouldn't dream of taking responsibility or ownership for the mess that it is and the problems that it causes others.As a frequent flyer with airlines one earn ""status"" and supposed perks. As ""Executive Platinum"" with American for the last 20 years one of those perks is a special phone number I can call to get assistance with problem. Well ... that's really nice. But guess what?  This special line DOES NOT WORK!  I called it 15 times last night and waited 2 hours for a call back!! And when American's dumb shit computer finally called me back THERE WAS NO ONE ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE!!So, enough. I am transferring my loyalty to United Airlines. It will mean more connections. But I'll take five connections over sitting at the airport for five hours and getting nowhere. Experience today was ridiculous, and American has had not one word to say to me about its poor performance.  United doesn't always get it right, and United is not without problems.  But when United has a problem, it is my experience that they own the problem, they apologize for the problem, and they have empowered their employees to make it right. Sounds worthy of loyalty.  So from here on out, they will have mine."
This is the most terrible company I have a metAmerican Airlines always late in the flights the airplane never clean and smell goodI'm not recommend to do business with this Mickey Mouse company
"I'm so mad at American Airlines. Truly-Southwest is the only airlines that cares about their passengers. I flew Santa Barbara to Phoenix with two bags-gate checked one and carried one on. First off-the flight board st the airport said flight was delayed 90 minutes so I walked 15 minutes away to get food. The board remained to show the delay. Thankfully a friend texted me that it was in time. The board still showed delayed. So I called American out of courtesy to let them know. I also stopped at their customer service desk-out of courtesy. They finally changed the board-20 minutes prior to the flight.  I hope nobody missed the flight. Then, while Boarding my connection-the agent insisted my bag was too big-I put it in the little guide that shows if it fits or not. It fit just fine. She insisted that I check it. She wouldn't even let me hate check it.  She was just RUDE. I even showed her that when I take the pillow and blanket out that it's really small. Why are sone people such prudes. Isn't it enough that traveling is already difficult?Truly frustrating. btw-I've flown with that sane bag on board at least a hundred times. She just wanted to give me a hard time."

"They left on time and got us to our destination 30 minutes early. The plane seats were comfortable.  The landing was smooth.          The things that kept it from being 5 star is they didnt have the ATeam at the check in desk. Luckily we arrived early so not stressed about missing the plane. Maybe they are new and learning but it was REALLY slow. The line wasnt moving, and some people started just bypassing the line and going to the front. None of the employees addressed that.  The staff were nice but wow need more people at check in especially if moving so slow.          Was very disappointed didnt get to watch movie on the plane. They dont have screens for movies .  You have to use your device .  I only had a phone with me so downloaded the American airline app.  My husband is much more techie and he worked for 30 minutes to try and get my phone to play a movie. His tablet did fine. But not having something to distract me made the flight seem long    . In all fairness anyone who knows me can attest that i am cursed ... anything electronic or technology. We are used to the seat in front having a screen on the back of it that would have been great."
"This airline is straight garbage. Never have any issues when I fly Delta. But the few times I have flown American, there is always an issue. I've been deplaned a couple of times and the flights seem to never be on time. Avoid at all costs."
Absolutely worst value for your money and seats are incredibly uncomfortable. You are treated like cattle. Its terrible.
Terrible. They oversell flights and then make people wait over an hour as the negotiate with people to give up their seats with ZERO regard or respect to the passengers affected who paid.
"The gate 23 flight to Phoenix from Austin agent was MEAN, RUDE and ANGRY. PLUS, not consistent. I wonder if it is because that I am not white. I can't believe this still goes on. People were boarding with over sized luggage. They were white. She saw me take my purse out of my mini backpack to get my medicine. BUT YELLED AT ME TO GET OUT OF MY PAID FIRST CLASS SEAT AND INTO THE OTHER LINE WHILE I STUCK IT IN MY BACKPACK. I should of gone w the disability folks because I had major surgery and can't carry over ten pounds. The agent said that she puts her purse in her backpack. She was laughing and enjoying being unkind, rude and mean. Many people told me it was because they hate first class people. I think they hate non whites. Just saying."
"My citi card application and acceptance has been the worst experience possible. If I knew it would be like this I would have never applied. Having to talk to customer service three different times on the phone just to get my application approved because the citi application process glitched leaving me in limbo for weeks. Then I get told that I am approved to expect my new card. On the day that I'm supposed to get my new card I just get a notice from citi bank saying that they need more information and provided another application number and reference id... I already had done this two weeks prior where you go online and enter the reference id. What is ridiculous is that it didn't have me enter any additional information, it just said that is all we need after the id was entered. This whole process has been a complete waste of my time. What is truly unfortunate and unfair to me is that I was going through all of this so that I could use my card for upcoming travel and because citi took months to even process my application I couldn't use the card on my travel and missed out on the American airline points that I got this card for. Seriously has been such a pain. Not only that, but since I waited extra days to book the flights due to the promises from the phone citi agent that my new card would arrive I ended up paying an extra $160 for my tickets all while still not being able to use my card. You really need to get your stuff together because no one should go through this."
"Shittest airline company ever, my flights got delayed multiple times already (8+ hours) as I am writing this review, and may not be the end of it. gate numbers always changing you have to constantly checking to make sure. It was a nightmare to flight with American Airlines, I saw many many groups of people also experiencing the same thing.For a 1300 domestic flight, this is a joke, they need to go back to beta testing before rolling out their service to the public."
Is there a reason why the lady doing the boarding is not calling anything by sections etc? She just keeps switching the screens?Is there a reason why u dont call priority boarding for military?
"I am beginning to like American Airlines more and more. My last few flights have been on time, I love the priority boarding and first free bag policy when you book with their credit card. The seats are comfortable and lately the staff has been nicer. American has improved!"
"Flew 1st class from Tulsa to Phoenix.   It was a waste of money.   They didn't have enough meals for everyone (meals included).   The attendant would leave the area and we couldn't get drinks (included in the price).   No pre-take off drinks.    I'm not trying to sound like a snob, but I paid nearly double for a first class ticket and these items are supposed to be included, at least that's what they told me. Luckily I had purchased some snacks before boarding.  I pull the tray out and it was filthy and sticky."
"Monday I show up for a flight from Phoenix to Norfolk Virginia. After a couple hours of sitting on the tarmac they decided the airplane was now air worthy. Tuesday I show up for the same flight and same story. This time the engine would not startI went to customer service immediately to request my suitcase. They said no problem it will be on carousel 5 in 30 minutes to two hours.  I waited an hour and went to ask again for status. They told me "" sorry your bag is going on another plane to Norfolk but we will get Norfolk to send it back and it will be delivered to your home tomorrow by 4. "".   Wednesday at 7 I called to say that it was past 4 and no suitcase.  They said "" right, it is in Norfolk"". I asked why it wasn't shipped to me as promised. They had no answer. Finally today it was sent back to me. Having lost all confidence in the competency of American Airlines I drove to the airport to retrieve my suitcase rather than let their delivery service lose my suitcase. To recap two busted airplanes 5 round trips to the airport over 4 days  lost suitcase for 3 days.  Apologies?  None.  Find a real airline and skip Awful Airlines"
"My first flight of the day was terrible. The entire flight crew was in a bad mood and acted as if the passengers were responsible. One of the elite crew was so consumed with flirting with a passenger with Rochmonaf (sic) Concert #3 music on his lap, she leaned into him and her back end was 2"" from my face! She did not close the bathroom door and let out a scream when it banged open during takeoff. She did not know the caption turned off the seatbelt sign when we had been parked for at least two minutes.I hope they rest up and try again."
