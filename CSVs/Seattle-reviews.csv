"Utilized this airline to fly from Tallahassee to Dallas to Seattle - and back. With all of the delays and cancellations that have been prevalent throughout the summer, we didn't run into any problems. All of our flights were on time. The attendants on all of the flights were super nice, as were the captains. The flights were smooth, except for a bit of turbulence we encountered on the flight back from Dallas to Tallahassee. Great service, more than decent meals. We had chicken, garlic mashed potatoes, salad, and a roll for dinner - but I apparently deleted the photo in error before I could post it! Of note, having vanilla bean gelato after a midflight dinner is simply awesome; can never go wrong with vanilla bean :o)! The breakfast included an enchilada with black beans, chicken sausage, a croissant, and fresh fruit. Note, I do have one small complaint regarding the wheelchair assistance that was set up by the airlines. When we arrived in Dallas, expecting a wheelchair when we walked off the plane, the guy standing there just looked at us; when we tried to verify if the wheelchair was for my husband, he shrugged as if he didn't have clue. We had to end up hunting for the assistance we had requested and were assured was set. Oh well, things certainly don't always go as planned!"
"An afternoon flight back to Dallas. Fantastic it was to have a skycap available to checkin my luggage. At gate, my plane arrived late, a 15-minute delay for all to de-board and an apparent quick tidy & clean up.Welcomed on board. Settled in a very comfortable seat. Careful nowadays, using my sanitizing wipes in wiping down the knobs and tray. Lifted my window shades, into my flying zone, up in the clouds soon.CHEERS!"
"This review focuses on AA's narrow body 3-class Transcon aircraft, these only fly from BOS-LAX, JFK-SFO/LAX, and some east-west coast flights at these airports only. AA only have 17 of these A321. Flew out of BOS, nice lounge, gate area and boarded on time. Quick to board when the aircraft only seats 102. When boarding seeing the 1-1 first was different, your thinking wide body but only an aisle, walked through another gallery/lav area and found my seat in a 2-2 business class seat. You have so much space for seat storage. Settled in and flight attendant offering juice, water and sparkling wine. Nice pre-departure drink, appears first had the same service, enjoyed while I read the service menu and food options. Settled in pushed back and on time departure and did arrive a little early too. Seat took a little adjustment to find the right position, and these seats to lay flat. Flight service, AA seems to have a little extra on domestic first-business class, but these transcons are serve more like an international flight. It was breakfast time, had a nice fruit, entrée and cheese courses, it was good and hot, remember at 30k ft. Food tastes blander. Attempted to use the inflight entertainment system in the seat, difficult to use, very sensitive remote and clunky. Finally able to put up the flight maps and used my iPad to access the WiFi system. The AA entertainment system has good and current offerings and caught up on some films wanting to watch. You can watch a commercial and get 30 minutes of free internet access, nice to check and reply to emails. Again cannot say enough about AA flight attendants and service, about the best on domestic air, about the last 1.5 snacks and fresh baked cookies come around along with fresh cocktails too. Arrived to LAX, being a Trancon flight with First or Business ticket you have access to that lounge, go grab a bite, drink or use the bathroom when arriving."
"I arrived at SEA well in advance of my scheduled afternoon flight out of this airport, and went to the American Airlines check-in counter to ask if they could put me on an earlier set of flights so I could get home to see my family earlier than scheduled.  She took a look at my electronic boarding pass and my passport and booked me on an earlier set of flights, but I'd need to be on standby for both.  She explained if the standby flights were full, I'd just take my originally scheduled (later) flights, as both were still ticketed.As luck turned out, there were 3 no-shows for the flight out of SEA, most likely due to a nearly last-minute gate change. They offered me one of those seats after everyone else had boarded and they went on the plane to do a manual head count.  I was a bit rushed when they finally called my name and they never gave me a boarding pass for the second leg of my journey, but at least I made it onboard and was seated on the earlier flight.After that, everything was pretty standard on the actual flight and we even got to the arrival city about 20 minutes earlier than scheduled."
"I flew AA first class from the mainland US to Hawaii, and had a good experience. The seats were comfortable with lots of room to spread out, and the staff were all very friendly! My only qualm was that I was unaware the seats do not recline flat at the time of booking  - a few other airlines have this feature in business class but AA did not with their first class seats. For a long flight over the ocean, a fully reclinable seat would have been nice, but, not a dealbreaker.Our luggage arrived just fine with no delays, and our family would fly AA again. We had no delays, and even arrived a few minutes earlier than expected."
"I flew on American Airlines from Miami to Seattle. A 6 hour flight. It took the flight attendants 2 hours into the flight to serve a small bag of pretzels and one soft drink. There was no other food served.Then, when we land in Seattle, 7 passengers (I was one of them) had their luggage sent to Dallas/Ft Worth!In the last 10 years I have flown on numerous airlines, domestically and international and I have never had service this terrible."
With any company - there are good people who work for organizations who as a whole just stink. I feel for those who work for American - because the corporate culture and how they approach the airline business and the treatment of cattle - excuse me - customers - is poor. The only time I fly American is when I'm forced to for work - other than that - I avoid it. The whole attitude is as a passenger you are an inconvenience and we will put up with you because you give us money. Customer service/care is lacking and do you really need 9 different boarding groups?They say in capitalism sometimes business need to be left to fail in order to make an industry stronger - American Airlines is one of those companies who should wither away.
I normally will not fly American Airlines and I've never had a reason other than I prefer Southwest or Alaska.  Over the past few months I've had to fly American more than I would like.   It seems that every flight has experienced since kind of delay.   Every flight either left late or arrived and had to sit and wait for something.   One flight was 30 plus minutes 20 feet away from the gate because the didn't have anyone to bring us in.  I get it that is difficult to plan all the things but other airlines seem to do it without issue.  I'm only giving good a two start because Ive had a few amazing flight attendants.
"Flights scheduled months in advance. First flight was changed to take off 7 hours earlier, so we'll have to leave home at 2a. Our seats were changed so no one was sitting together. Adjoining seats were available, so we fixed it and have to deal with the time difference. Return flight was changed weeks later, adding an over 11hr delay (overnight) in Texas. Contacted the airline (which took several hours.). It's like a fortified wall to hit your head against. No alternative that isn't over 10 additional hours travel time. To shave off that one hour required we'd fly even further away - adding a stop in FL, while still going through TX, layovers throughout. No alternatives the day before or after. No hotel nearby without paying full price out of pocket. No partnerships with other airlines. No discounts or waived fees. Literally just do not care about customer experience in the slightest.It's nerve-racking enough traveling with every going on right now. But best case scenarios of everything going right from here is still appalling. And at this rate, not trusted in the slightest. If there is ANY other option, do not use American."
I have been on hold three times for up to two hours trying to check-in for an international. I used their VeriFLY app and everything was completed and approved but AA mobile app can't confirm the approval from its own vendor.  Now we have to leave for the airport several hours early to make sure we can fly. As a frequent business flyer I would not recommend AA.

"Would not use this airline again. First and last time.AA your seats are too freaking small and too close to the rows in front/behind of each other.Why do you charge $30 for one piece of luggage to be brought on the plane? I have a disability (short-term) and can't move quickly or carry heavy things. Asked for help getting my suitcase onto the weight platform at check-in and got a hard stare back. Had to struggle and start spasming terribly before the guy got the picture and did it for me. Shouldn't have had to do that. My friends bought my tickets to go see them. I have always heard, in business and from the majority of people, to not use AA. Now I know why from personal experience."
"They take your money, double and triple what they charged 1-2 years ago and then routinely cancel or delay your flights, so you have to pay extra for hotels and rental cars, for us, to the tune of several days. They lost our baggage and never bothered to follow up with us. Their running excuse is, ""pilot shortage"", well why didn't they say so when they were taking our money, no delays there? They did offer an alternative to their cancelled flights, we could reroute our 7 hour flight to a nearly 30 hour flight. This kaka has been their standing policy/excuse for at least 6 months. If you are delayed don't for get to make sure they guarantee an assinged seat on the next flight, so it doesn't happen all over again. You are also entitled to compensation, not that they'll tell you so. Also, don't use the kiosk to check in if you have TSA precheck or a discount through a credit card, you won't get them from their ticket/gumball machine. Think our next vacation, we'll take the car, a dog sled or just walk, it'll be faster and cheaper. Even tickets on the Titanic was a better experience, at least some of them made it."
"If you are disabled and try to change your seat to accommodate disability, they charge you Extra. Other airlines do not."
"It's like a Seinfeld script, multiple trip delays and rerouting hassles via other airlines resulting in 10 hours delay due to mechanical problems with plane. But not before they sent our bags to two separate cities ! Ducked and dodged questions entire process when asking for compensation and resolution. Online refund service doesn't work. Overall cost of tickets higher than better airlines by time they finished nickel and diming us. I'd have had a better flight gluing wings on the SS Titanic and flying that."
"I recently took a trip to Ohio for a few days and then on to Texas. On our first leg, we transferred from Alaska Airlines to American Airlines. American lost my bag during my transfer. My boyfriend and I both talked to both airlines, especially American, several times. American kept trying to deflect the problem on Alaska. We voiced several times that I needed that bag bc my meds were in there and the warm clothes I needed for Ohio. To get to the end, American FINALLY got it to me FIVE weeks later. Nobody went to look for it even tho we had stressed how imp it was to get it back. ALSO, it was very obvious my bag had been gone through. All my jewelry was stollen as well as some clothing. My suggestion is to never put important things in checked luggage. It was a very expensive and stressful trip."
"This was my first experience with American Airlines, and it was the worst experience I have ever had with an airline. A credit of $200.00 feels like a slap in the face after multiple contacts with their poor customer service considering the ordeal I went through due to American Airlines' egregious errors.My first flight was scheduled to be on time. We boarded the plane then sat in the cold plane for 2 hours due to maintenance needing to de-ice the plane. The first deicer was not working properly, which prolonged the wait. All of this would have not warranted a formal complaint but given the myriad of unacceptable events that followed on the return flight.The return flight was originally scheduled for one gate, then when we got to the airport after standing in line at TSA for over an hour, the gate was changed. They boarded us on the plane at our original time and told us that there was an issue with the gas cap and maintenance was trying to fix it. Over 2 hours went by while maintenance tried to locate a new gas cap, then we were told we had to de-board the plane as they were unable to locate a replacement and that there was another plane waiting for us at another gate across the airport.We got to that gate and waited another hour where we were told the gate changed yet again. After we got to that gate, we got an email that our seats had been changed. They announced after an hour of waiting at that gate that there were not enough seats on the plane and asked for volunteers to take another flight and we were promised a voucher of $1,200.00 each for volunteering. Both my partner and I were the first to volunteer. We had to wait for everyone to board the plane before we could get our change of flight tickets, then after over an hour of waiting for everyone else to get on the plane, the pilot walked out, and they canceled the entire flight. We were stuck standing in line waiting for another 2+ hours to change our flight. We were given a hotel voucher that we could not use because there were no shuttles to the hotel after midnight and we would have had to pay out of our own pocket to go to the hotel and back for only 2 hours and turn around and come back for the flight they booked us on 4 hours later because there were no other flights scheduled that we could get on at the time.Then, our direct flight was changed to a layover. We were given food vouchers that could only be used in In the initial airport, but due to the time, everything was already closed and wouldn't reopen until after we had already boarded the 5 AM flight so we were unable to use the food vouchers. We had to stay in the airport with no food and no sleep overnight.The flight they booked us on that was a layover, rather than our original direct flight changed our boarding group from 7 to 8, which made it almost impossible for us to find a place to put our bags in the overhead bins, which left us with very little leg room and the inability to lean our seats back. We were given seats at the very back of the airplane on both the flights where we could not put our seats back and were unable to sleep even though we had been awake all night waiting in the airport due to our canceled flight and other mishaps that American Airlines was responsible for. When we got to the layover city, due to being on the very end of the airplane, we almost missed our short connection to Our final destination and had to run through the airport and barely made it in time, once we got on that plane it was again delayed for another 30+ minutes."
"Had an unbelievably awful experience with American, and no, this has nothing to do with COVID, fly business with Alaska and Delta weekly for 8 months now and have never had this problem.Was supposed to take off Monday, flight was cancelled 2 hours before flight pushed to Tuesday, 21 hours later.This left us at an airport in a foreign country. Had to be taken to a hotel American Airlines covered. Because the whole flight needed a room, check in at the hotel took nearly 3 hours. Arrived next day, front desk gave us wrong information, both gate and time for take off were wrong.Connection once in the states delayed 2 hours on top of this.Cherry on top - baggage was delayed by 1 hour after the final connection. I don't ever write reviews, but truly felt compelled to do so to warn others. I will not be choosing American again."
"The worst reward program. AA just changed our Seattle-Iceland reward reservation so as to add a total of two extra stops and 8 extra hours of flight time. On a route we specifically attempted to avoid by booking the flight we did. Incredible. Terrible customer service. Webpage doesn't address any tough situations (such as what they just did to us). Nobody answers the phone. We left a call back number ... and received a call back 7 hours after the time originally identified by their system ... in the middle of the night when we were sleeping. Emails are buried deep in the website, in a way that makes you think they are intentionally trying to make it difficult to connect. Rewards itinerary travel times are obscenely long and indirect. No. No more. We are leaving this shitshow first chance we get. Been a loyal customer for 20 years. This service doesn't merit our loyalty/business."
"If you want to be confident you will get the flight you paid for, apparently you need to look at other airlines.  We booked a nonstop flight for the family on American Airlines from Seattle to London.  We were all really excited.  Then without any notice AA changed our nonstop flight to one with an extended stop in Orlando and much longer combined flight time.  For our troubles, they offered to refund us a measly $100 per ticket.  This did not work for our travel plans.  And now that we are looking at other airlines, ticket prices have increased dramatically.  It's now doubtful we'll be able to make the trip.  No more AA for us."
"Continuing to disappoint. Four flights on this trip, all departed late and three arrived late. Upon arrival at final leg, 20 minutes before they were able to open the door as no gate agent showed up. Even after it taking 30 minutes from landing to deplaning, baggage took an HOUR! WTF?!Will you ever get anything right?Select any other airline unless you enjoy wasting time, bad service, and careless attitudes."
"NOT RECOMMENDED. Not enough staff at the counter to check people in. I saw 2-3 staff just hanging around at the empty counters and chatting with others. Everyone seemed to be very frustrated with that inefficiency. Waited for an hour from 4 am to check in my luggage and finally, it was my turn, but I couldn't make it the flight. I was flying internationally, so they messed up all of my itinerary and were not helpful at all. The staff told me, ""Well, I can't help you. Please call the airline( international) help center. "" Super upsetting. My travel agency helped me up right away over the phone and flying with Delta now. Goodbye, extra $330. I will not fly with AA ever again."
"Horrible experience!  Booked flight for my fiancée and myself to head back home after Christmas, we were placed in different rows and when we dropped our bag we were told to wait until the ticket counter opened at the gate and talk to the gate agent about changing seats. As soon as a body appeared at the gate, I preceded to walk towards the desk where a younger woman literally ran in front of me. When it was my turn to talk to the agent who was extremely rude and unhelpful, I was told there were no more seats together as the woman in front of me had just gotten the last two seats together. The agent was so rude. She said I could wait until the cutoff for check in and if I wouldn't let her speak, she would just let me have my boarding passes back and deal with it. Never flying American again!!!! What horrible customer service!!!!!"
"This was quite personal and difficult for me to write about, but I decided to speak up. Long story short, an AA desk employee at seatac violated ADA and made this a painful, humiliating experience, while screaming at me for sitting. I had a spine injury which prevented me from walking (I'm better now, thanks). I had requested wheelchair assistance in advance, and was told they'd meet me at the curb because I couldn't walk. I was flying to see my doctor.When the curbside assistance refused me (they ""weren't doing it today""), I enlisted help from my significant other, who carried me to the ticketing desk. I told the lady behind the desk that I needed to sit down or get a wheelchair. She snapped that there was no wheelchair reservation (why even give a confirmation number then, AA? But okay, things happen) and that I'd have to lift my luggage to the scale to check it in. I politely explained that i was in a great deal of pain just standing and putting all my weight on the counter, and that I needed to sit or get a wheelchair, and if she'd be so kind to get someone to help me. (My significant other had to go back to the car, which he was forced to have illegally taxii'd, thanks American airlines). The lady asked, ""what's wrong with you"", and I replied, again, I can't walk. More back and forth and her repeating, ""You're gonna have to lift your luggage ma'am!!!"" At this point, I'd been standing for much longer than was possible for me, so I was close to tears. I reminded her that I require assistance, but also that I'd be sitting now. She proceeded to yell at me from behind the desk as I hobbled and limped over to a seat. She escalated and yelled at me for not lifting my luggage on to the scale. For the 20th time. A seatac worker helped me with my bags, and seeing my pain, ordered a wheelchair that the AA lady would not. This experience is honestly shocking beyond words. Disabled people are not your emotional punching bags, American Airlines. This is far below the bare minimum standards to human decency and treating people with a sliver of dignity. I get it when people have bad days, but not when you're just plain evil and want to maliciously humiliate a younger looking person for a disability. Get it together AA. I have a hundred thousand miles that I sorely wish I could transfer. Protip: if you want to break up with an airline, book a flight on their website for a partner airline."
"If I could give less than one star, I would. We had to wait for our Covid results at the San Jose airport in Costa Rica. We were prepared for that (made an appt, arrived four hours before our flight, etc.) but the lab was extremely delayed and despite our repeated calls to them, we didn't get our results until almost an hour exactly before our international flight left. We hustled to the counter and were ""helped"" (if you could call it that) by J. Castro. He informed us we couldn't board this late and was extremely rude and condescending. My husband is much calmer and more patient than I am and even he was at the point of losing it. J. Castro said we had to board much earlier and that it was posted everywhere and we should have planned better. Not only that, but our connecting flight was flat out cancelled and delayed an entire day. That was literally the worst customer service experience I've ever had. I won't be flying American ever again."
These guys have to make everything difficult. All I'm asking is where their cargo location is at. I have a dog being flown in and they are going in circles.
"The worst customer service ever. Beware of two customer associates that works at the front desk. One is an Asian looking guy named Gabe and the other one is an Indian lady name tag said ODE on it. Got denied boarding last second because this guy Gabe told us ""I think your dog is too big"". After charging us and checking our bag in. You could've said something when the second you saw our dog. Also our dog is not too big and who are you to make judgement on that? By looking at him and telling us YOU THINK? The weight limit for in cabin pets is 20lbs and they didn't even let us weigh our dog to prove it. They claimed that he won't be able to stand, sit and walk in our carrier bag. First of all, just cause he wasn't in the bag atm while checking in. Doesn't mean he is too big for our carrier bag. They don't make any sense and trying to say that we have an attitude towards them. That's ridiculously unacceptable and unprofessional act. He also told us that he's been doing this for over 15 years. Well no wonder why you haven't got a promotion yet still working at the front. I had to call and email customer relations department to file complaint on them to get a refund for everything and ended up paying double to fly out and also waited at the airport for extra 5 hours. I'm sure there's good people working in AA but if you are just trying to pick and be difficult on us for no reason? That's NOT OK. I'll never take American Airlines again!!!!"
"They gave out ziplock bags with cookies, a small bottle of water and a hand sanitizer wipe as soon as we boarded the plane. They do charge $30.00 for one checked bag. Not that I was worried, but amid COVID-19 restrictions, the plane was completely full. You know how they check to see if you tray tables are up and seatbelts checked? Well, now it's to make sure you have your masks on. It's that serious about the masks. They announce that you may not be able to fly with them again, if you don't wear one. The seatbelt check is a second thought check. With that said, kids/children were able to board planes with or without masks. We all know how kids can be. Eating food was also not a problem even if you brought it on the plane. Since you are packed in tight, masks are a must and make sure you carry Lysol wipes to wipe down everything you're gonna touch. You are now able to carry 12 ounces of liquid hand sanitizer on the plane with you according to their guidelines. Share with friends sitting beside you. Respect the disease but don't live in fear."
"I will not be flying with American Airlines again. Our flight to LAX from Seatac was delayed over 7 hours causing us to miss a special birthday for my 10 year old daughter. I could only take a short amount of time off work so we had purchased 2 days worth of park passes from Friday 2/14-Sunday 2/15. The rental car, hotel stay and park passes that were purchased were completely unusable for one of the 2 days making for a short trip. The staff at the service desk (Kat) was very rude,and insensitive only offering us meal vouchers for the inconvenience. My out of pocket expenses lost in this matter were over $700.00. I don't think 2 $12 dollar meal vouchers is a worthy compensation for our lost time and money cutting our trip short, and providing terrible customer service"
"This was not a good experience.I purchased a flight that left later than I had intended (the mobile app was difficult to use and I assumed I'd be able to resolve the issue by speaking with a person), and tried to change it to the correct one at the airport (to a flight departing from the same gate, slightly earlier which was not at full capacity).  I explained my situation to the desk agent and later to a CSR on AA's hotline, and was told that they couldn't help change the flight but I was free to buy a ticket for $210 for the earlier flight if i wanted.What?  How does that seem reasonable at all?  I understand that flights fill up, but if there are still seats available (AA would be happy to sell me one) I don't understand what is to be gained by being unhelpful as a policy.I'll obviously wait the two hours at the airport before giving AA another cent, and never fly with American again - I guess service just isn't what it used to be.Thanks for nothing, AA."
"Yeah, I'm tired and I wanna go home. In less than 12 hours j get 3 cancelled flights then a major delay. Then once we board, there's a '""mechanical"" Issue that won't take long to fix and now an hour later, I'm typing this up cuz I'm still waiting in the airplane for it to taxi out. How about some free drinks or food or anything. Shoot I'll take some sympathy but not even that. I used to like American but now I'm thinking twice. I'll give up my miles and start building it on another airline. Geez, this sucks. Anyways signing off as I still sit here. Hoping that mechanical issue doesn't crash this plane. If it does, this will be my last review for help. Anyways, bon voyage!"
"While entering my flight today 11/28/20 from Chicago to Seatc (AA2905) I asked the flight attendant, an older blonde lady, if I could get some assistance placing my carry on in an overhead compartment as I have very limited range of motion in a shoulder and can have difficulty lifting anything above my head. As another flight attendant grabbed my bag to help, a middle aged brown haired lady, the older blonde yelled out to me, ""She isn't paid to get hurt by helping with bags."" The tone and everything about her remark was rude and inappropriate. It may be in AA's best interest to make sure they don't have such fragile flight attendants, and hire only those who can assist without hUrTiNg themselves. Or hire one's that can POLITELY just tell me no, and don't yell out rude comments as I'm walking down the aisle."
"This airlines sucks!!!!Costumer service has 12 hours waiting.my mom is lost , she does not speak English and she is handicap. No one answer about her. Her flight got cancel snd i still do not know where she is..She is coming from a 15 hours flight and no answers. AA realllllly bad costumer services on phone. People does not help. They dont care and they treat you bad on the phone."
