Never had a problem with American Airlines at the EWR airport in New Jersey. Customer service is always friendly and helpful. Never a line to check bags. I've had nothing but a great experience with American Airlines!
4-21-22 and 4-23-22Flew MIA to EWR and returned two days later EWR to MIA American is my preferred airline. The choices for me this trip was Spirit from FLL 10 minutes from my house or American from MIA 1 hour away. Last minute flight so going window seat back of plane more people than should legally be allowed. Yes mask mandate is over but I left mine on so I wouldn't have to smell the passenger next to me. Also love the new snack instead of the biscoff cookies which I am sick of a nice nut mix which included pecans. Returning left late as we were waiting on a crew member but surprisingly enough landed half hour early in MIA. That flight there was only 70 something passengers so I got my own row to sleep.Thank you American for being a constant that I can count on.
"Hellllll no. Don't take this airline from Newark. Security line is around the terminal, then they don't even tell you that you can go into the other empty security line and take a shuttle. I'm sure people missed their flight over the poor logistics management at TSA. Also, everyone is sooo so rude. You can tell they're all miserable. Just a bad experience all the way around."
"The absolute worst airlines on the planet. Delays , rude and unavailable . Sat on the plane for 3 plus hours and they didn't even offer water ? 7 hours wait on the phone, the app doesn't work and  unwilling to help on every level . As a 1K world traveler , I've tried them all and without question, they are at the bottom ."
"Traveling from Newark, NJ to Phoenix Arizona via American Airlines was easy. It was a full flight but lines moved quickly and efficiently. I like that they had assigned seats so being next to last to board didn't matter to me. The staff was very nice and accommodating. One thing I would have liked is them letting us know an area we were in. We traveled over some really interesting looking places and I would have loved to know where. I also took a star away because there was NO WIFI for the entire 5 hour flight. I had my book with me so I didn't mind but my 15 year old daughter was a bit lost lol. Other than that easy, worry free flight."
"I have traveled with US Airways / American for 30years.  American has been my airline of choice for all my flights. I have little issues with them and they are typically on time.  The captain and crew have been so courteous.  That said, my experience in the airports I travel through h be been the complete opposite.  I don't believe this is for all of them but I could easily say 75% of the gate agents are rude, inpatient, and simply do not want to give bothered. The worst one was recently when flying through Dallas Fort Worth. This gate agent at DFW on Wednesday afternoon August 11, 2021 a flight going to CLT was the worst individual I have ever encountered.  I was not the only one either. An American Airlibes employee was treated just as poorly as I was and HE WORKS FOR THE SAME COMPANY.  Another nice gentleman behind me asked about whether or not he cleared the wait list as he was the first one on the list.  This guy is an executive platinum member with American.  This gate agent said he we oukd have to wait like everyone else and she was working the list.  Mind you the other gate agent who was also there was courteous to everyone.  A gentleman came up to her ... Same question about clearing the wait list.  Guess what...he got a confirmed seat immediately.   What?  Come to find out there were 30 open seats.  So the #1 person on the list with a ton of miles with American was treated this way, I was treated the same, and her own colleague, do you think this person should be in this position?  I don't.  She should be happy she has a job.  Maybe she is working alot but I can tell you as a nurse myself working 6 days a week she has NO idea. American I only hope you evaluate this gate agent.  She should not represent your brand."
We really lucked out that Darling was our customer service representative because she was extremely helpful and very considerate. The four stars are pretty much only for her.
Garbage. First class felt like coach and coach felt like trash. Delays after delays. 15$ vouchers for a hotel when our Costa Rican flight got diverted toMiami. Definitely staying far away from AA. better service on JetBlue or United.
"Horrible! Do yourself a favor and use any other airline. Not only are they over priced but you will be treated like   an animal. Delays and cancellations and no one will tell you why. You will spend hours delayed at an airport only for the staff to give you major attitude before they cancel your flight. I've flown American before and never had an issue. Now they claim that post Covid, there are too many travelers and they can't handle it. If the airline cannot handle your business than give your business to someone else! Once your flight is canceled, you will have to fight for the refunds and vouchers that you are entitled to! Fucking trash airline."
"Great customer service!!! Would definitely recommend them."" Aug 21, 2021LouiseBelleMead (14 reviews)Belle Mead, NJI booked non-refundable tickets with American for travel to attend a Memorial service. Subsequently, the venue changed the date to outside my flight timeframe so I cancelled my flights. I called American and explained the situation. THEY GAVE ME A FULL REFUND!!!Bottom Line: I highly recommend American Airlines for excellent customer service."
Start your review of American Airlines.
This has got to be the worst airline ever!! First flight was cancelled right off the bat and then Sat with hundreds of other people at terminal A at Newark airport yesterday as we all waited as our flights got delayed and delayed and ultimately cancelled.  An entire Father's Day weekend getaway ruined.  Sucks!!!!! Will not fly them again.
"When you call customer service, they encourage you to check online for updates. No wonder humans are being replaced by robots. Pointless and not helpful at all. Especially when online updates weren't even updated.  Get it together American!"
"Worst airline I've ever flown.  Dirty planes and god awful Customer Service.  I used to fly 100,000 miles for business and told my corporate travel agent to avoid them at all costs."
"Now that we're essentially grounded, I have to say service on American Airlines has never been better. No flights and no passengers guarantee ample legroom and an automatic score on an upgrade. And gee whiz, no more surly malcontents behind the counter barking boarding instructions in German. And I just know they're going to use their bailout windfall to improve service, vanquish fees and mandate smiles all around. I just know it. Have a swell day."
I wish I could give this airlines zero stars. They are absolutely incompetent and rude. I had spoke to a representative and was told that I would get a full refund if I were to cancel a flight I was no longer able to go on. After this representative assured me I would get a full refund for my flight I went ahead and cancelled and then was told I was not eligible for a refund. Nikita the supervisor was nothing but rude and completely unhelpful. I asked her a question and she completely ignored me and ended the conversation. In the past flying with American I have had absolutely nothing but problems and inconveniences. I would pay for any airline over this one.
I would rather have someone run over my face with a lawnmower then ever use these services again
They just switched my flight from departing at 6am we are all loaded to departing at 7am I have work today and now Im going to be late  Im glad I can count on them
"I had the worst experience. When I traveled to Ecuador it was all fine. But when I come pack they charge 45$ for my carryon I don't remember hearing about that and no one told me and they charged my carryon because the airplane is ""small"" it wasn't suppose to be charged which is so annoying and I am so upset. And then we went back to Miami and they made me lose my flight until they wanted to reschedule my flight and that's my bad experience and I will never fly with them."
"July (first few days of the month) 2019 -Booked roundtrip flights from Bogota to Miami to Milan for May 2020.March 2020 -Free exchange - modified flights to October (as listed above).May 21, 2020 -Viewed flight information online - listed roundtrip to Miami only (NO communication from them that flights were modified).Called and did free exchange.  Roundtrip flights from Bogota to Miami to London to Milan.June (I called early June) -Canceled flights and received free credit tor future travel.  I knew if we waiting until early July, we could get tickets for May 2021.July 2 - Spoke to American Air and changed flights to May 2021. Booked roundtrip flights from Bogota to Miami to Milan. No cost to modify flights. Also gave us $400 travel vouchers for future flights - we received emails for the updated tickets and the vouchers.July 5 - Viewed flight information - listed us flying from Bogota to  Miami to JFK to Milan.  In JFK, gave us 24 minutes to make the connecting flight to Milan.  The return showed Milan to JFK to Miami.  In Miami, we would have to stay overnight and fly back the next evening (NO communication from them that flights were modified).  Called American Air (very early in the morning) and canceled tickets.  Getting full refund (for the tickets).Booked roundtrip flights on Lufthansa from Bogota to Frankfurt to Milan."
"Let's just say i had a flight tomorrow morning where it was going to be very convenient. Now this morning flight at 730 got cancelled because they didn't have enough flight crew, why would you notify us less than 12 freaking hours about this cancellation? If you knew you wouldn't have enough crew why would you wait less than 12 hours before instead of saying it earlier in the day? I'm ashamed, they're lucky I have too many miles to use or else I wouldn't fly them again"
"Ridiculous to pay $568 for a domestic ticket and then be asked to pay an additional $12 more to ""choose"" my seat - even if its back row middle.  Paying to choose from available seats just shows that AA still nickels & dimes their customers every chance they get.  It's not a transparent, honest way to do business.  American Airlines does not demonstrate integrity with customer pricing, which is probably the case in every area of their business, including customer safety."
"If I could give NO STATS, I would. Never on time.  Always rebooking and rescheduling because no one inspects the plane.  Last time first flight of the day and plane needed a battery. Today we flew halfway (1hr) to our destination (that was 2hrs away.). Crew detected ""toxic fumes"" and instead of flying the hour forward to the destination, we flew an hour back to where we came from. All flights for everyone on the plane rescheduled.  I was supposed to arrive in Gainesville FL at 2p but ended up getting in after 11pm and completely missing my job interview bc that was the soonest they could do... it wasn't good enough. American is the worst airline. Completely unreliable. I will not book another flight with American again."
"Real revue, from a real customer, based on the experience flying from Newark to Paris connecting in Chicago.Do not, under any circumstances fly American. No matter how little you pay for the ticket!"
"I think it is terrible that during this crisis you are only offering change options through the end of this year.  We do not know if travel will be safe in December as we do not know when this pandemic will be over. Your customer service was extremely rude unprofessional and short. This is by far one of the worst pandemic responses and cancellation policies I have encountered,and this after having to cancel/alter three trips. It is deplorable that you treat your customers like this especially during these unprecedented times.  I will not be using your airline in the future and will be sure to let everyone know how little AA thinks of their customers safety and hard earned money.  Disgraceful."
Here we are going to bail out the airlines and they Now are playing games.  Delaying flights 3 hours to combine planes due to low passengers.  Year no compensation to to us for sitting 3 hours in the airport.  More corruption.   I think that the government should take into consideration the services provided during the crises and reward the airlines that continue to keep on time planes and not play games with the very people who will be bailing them out.   American normally is pretty good except for the drunk pilot a few month back that was in a bar and 2 hours late.  Now the 3 hour wait to combine planes.   Sad.
"One particular lady we won't mention her name is a witch to say the least. Not only is my flight initially delayed it ends up being cancelled. The customer service I experience at this counter was beyond horrible. She made no concerned effort to diligently do what she was hired for. The level of attitude I experienced from her was unexplainable. Sorry dear but it isn't you that was stranded by an airline of choice and told to deal with it, there is nothing we will do for you. @americanairline you have failed! Immensely! #aa #americanajrline should review policy. Such a disappointing experience."
Decent service by staff. Some not as friendly as others. Airplanes have WiFi and you can watch free TV shows and movies on the AA app.
If i could give zero stars I would. Weekend of 08/10/18 was in Canada w friends who chose to fly American. I flew air canada. Both flights returing to nyc. American canceled due to weather. Air canada flew. Today (4 days later) flying from lga to las vegas w layover in Philadelphia. Flight to  Philadelphia canceled due to maintenance. American air rebooks me to but must leave from newark. I ask of they provide transportation since they are rebooking me at different airport. I was told that if i accept rebooking i am responsible for my own transportation. I frantically jumped in the first cab (cash only) in hopes of making my newly rebooked flight. Upon arrival to newark i spoke w a customer service rep for AA who told me they SHOULD have provided transportation bc is it was a mechanical issue n i should jump thru leaps and bounds of customer service refunds on their website. Nothing could be done to further accommodate me! And they tout goodwill compensation all over their website. Shame. Dont fly american.
Worst customer service. 6 hour delay at the last minute for a 6AM flight and they get angry when you ask any questions and give no clear answers. Use any other airline.
"This airline SUCKS! Not one person who works for AA in the DCAairport knows what's going or even cares! Rude employees, ineptness and lack of information was amazing! Would give NO STARS if I could! Should change your name; PROUD AMERICAN AIRLINES YOU ARE NOT!"
"So when you tell a customer that a wedding dress is considered ""company policy"" but the customer takes this from the ""company website"" your just lying.  The young man at Miami international airport just wanted to throw his non authority around at 11pm when I just want to go home.   Nice try and and A for effort but he along with the ""company policy"" was a joke   Next time read the manual.    And only in the alphabet of American Airlines does A and F go together.  When you can show me alphabet that they are together I will buy you a ticket!!"
"I would give them negative if I could.I like to think that I'm well travelled. I'm a Qantas frequent flyer & never have I received sichbad service in Australia. Ok except Jetstar, once.First of all the check in lady asked me twice if I was in the right line. Then asked me why I had to use a passport. Seriously? In NYC? I told her I don't have a US government issued id. Then I asked her my baggage allowance as the frequent flyer status I held & was told that she was ""too busy to check"" for me & to ring the airline.. Next I asked for a fragile sticker for my souvenirs & she said she ran out. I offered to find it for her then she said they don't use it anymore as they're not liable. Seriously?! I suppose airlines in the 3rd world countries r richer to be liable or r more attentive?!Then she told me to remove fragile items from my checked luggage. F.A.I.LI don't even understand y Qantas bothers to partner with such a retarded airline. I will rather fly budget if I'm getting the shits from One World alliance. Unbelievable."
"American Airlines has let me down once again...I fly out of NJ usually 3-5x a year. I have experienced many different airlines that are accommodating and make your flying experience comfortable. However, this time around with AA I haven't even made it to the airport yet and they're already a hassle. Hurricane Irma has made its destruction throughout the Caribbean and unfortunately that's where our destination was to. AA does not want to waive the change fee and after many conversations with rude customer service personnel all they could say was ""there's nothing more we can do."" Being told you have a year to fly out to the same destination after the island has been demolished was just like hearing them say ""tough luck."" This has happened previously in the past where flight changes had to be made with other airlines such as United Airlines and Delta due to severe weather damage and they were very understanding and accommodating unlike American Airlines. I would not recommend American Airlines to those who want to feel comfortable and secure with the ticket purchase they've made."
"American Airlines is making me exhausted.Third round trip flight in last 3 weeks and every trip has had delays. I almost missed a connection due to their late take off (because they forgot to load beverages for a flight from the West Coast to Washington DC). The gate agents have been rude and lack empathy or general care for the customers situation,So here we are again, delayed and AA is failing to just Communicate so we know what is going on.No, I don't recommend AA. They are as bad as United lately - guess I'll look at another airline in the future."
"I was on flight 1588 from Phoenix, AZ to Newark, NJ on Saturday, 11/30/19 seated in the first row of the main cabin.  I asked a flight attendant if I needed to use the restroom, where should I go and she told me that I could use the one in the front of the plane since I was so close to it.  I and other passengers in the first 3 rows did use the restroom in the front of the plane throughout the flight.  I used it twice and when I tried to use it a third time about an hour before landing the flight attendant working in the first class cabin told me there were two restrooms in the back of the plane and blocked me from accessing the restroom.  I didn't make a scene or say anything, I just went to the back and used the restroom there.  I was then surprised to see that 2 people from my row and 1 person from the row behind me used the restroom in the front of the plane after I was told I could not and the flight attendant didn't say anything to them.  I am Black and the flight attendant was White as were the passengers who used the restroom after I was told I couldn't, so I felt discriminated against based on my race.  I then saw the flight attendant playing with one of the first class passenger's lap child on the plane, both of which were Black so I thought perhaps he is just discriminatory against Black men, I don't know but his behavior was unacceptable.  I sent a complaint to American and after a week they responded and apologized for the situation, they also spoke with me and said they will start an investigation but I will not be informed of the outcome in anyway.  I asked them how I would have closure on this matter and they basically said I would have to trust that they would take care of it per their procedures and that they can't tell me anything further.  I told them that they need to reevaluate how they address these types of concerns in regard to the complainant; they may do absolutely nothing or they could fire the flight attendant, I wouldn't know either way.  What I do know is that I will be much more reluctant to fly on American from now on.  I have been flying for about 26 years both personally and for work and I've flown on a number of airlines to many destinations around the world and I've never had this experience.  So even if the flight is cheaper on American I would rather pay more and fly on another airline than be treated this way.  If I am on an American flight I will make sure to pay for a regular Economy seat not Basic, so that I am not seated by the airline anywhere near the front of the plane so that there is no reason to use the restroom in the front of the plane and avoid such a situation again.  This trip was during the Thanksgiving holiday and even when I purchased the ticket in the summer there were not many options for reasonably priced flights, this one was bout $500 and I had to go through a travel agent so I don't think I even had other fare class/seat options.  This was a very upsetting way to start of the holiday season.  I hope that the airline does look into this matter and addresses it accordingly but since there is no transparency I felt the need to share this unfortunate experience.  Hopefully, no one else will be in a similar situation."
"I am a big fan of AA because I enjoy the mileage reward program you earn for complimentary flights. I've redeemed miles for free flights and that's my main reason for being a fan. Some of their planes can use some updating and more comfortable seats like Jet Blue. However, at the end of the day I am looking for the airline with the best deal to get me where I have to go."
"I was informed we could bring a carry on each and a personal item. By the time we were in line, we had to check our bags, which meant we spent an extra 30 min picking them up, and were then 30 min late for a wedding rehearsal. There was still room in the overheads when we got on the plane.Flight attendants were friendly; plane was clean."
Horrible experience. First they changed our flight and we had to stop in Charlotte then Newark. We get off the plane go to get our luggage and it's on another flight. Had to wait at the airport for 2 hours to get our bag. The American Airlines rep at the baggage claim was so rude. Called customer service and she was also so rude. Not flying American again
Used to be a good airline.  Flight cancelled cause of rain. Ok. I get it. .  Had to find hotel no reimbursement. Got back to airport to learn my wife and I were booked on separate flights!!  I have an American Airlines CC. WILL be cancelled.   Horseshit service.  I paid for seat upgrades as well. Seems to have lost that as well!
"I have had American Airlines cancel flights before but my last experience was by far the worst! The customer service is rude and did  nothing to try to remedy my situation and will NEVER fly American Airlines again! You are a company with millions of dollars and can't even provide a hotel room when you leave your customers stranded for 24 hours in an airport after leaving them stuck on the tarmac for 5 hours? I will pay the few extra dollars and fly a European airline, American Airlines has old out of date planes with with frequent delays. Disgusting bourgeoisie capitalism."
Terrible customer service. Didn't have my record locator #. Customer service agent that was literally doing nothing at bag drop told me to stand in long line as there were only 2 full service customer service representatives there. This is why kiosks are taking the jobs of unhelpful people.
"Not bad, American, not bad at allIn general, I've not been overly impressed with American scheduled airlines, preferring instead to fly with young upstarts like JetBlue and Virgin. However, I found American an efficient way to fly from EWR to MIACheck in was quick and painless at 6am. I'm not sure why British self check in kiosks can't be similarly efficient (the self check in process in the UK takes just as long as the regular check in line). A quick bag drop and I was ready to head to securityThe $25 fee for check in luggage was irritating but that's fairly standard these days when flying in the StatesThe 737-800 plane was comfortable and there was even a free movie shown on the overhead screens. Free beverages but no food were offeredAmerican has just gone onto my 'happy to repeat' list"
"ABSOLUTELY F*CKING HORRIBLE. it's American Airline's fault that their website was down and nobody could check in prior to coming to the airport and there is absolutely NOBODY on the floor to help. Nobody had any idea what the lines were for, or for where since nobody was directing us anywhere. EVERYBODY in the area has missed their flight. The employees that are supposed to assist you want absolutely nothing to do with you. We had a connecting international flight to Japan, which we are now going to miss, and we have been stuck on line to check in for over an hour now. I don't even know when we'll make it to Japan now. I am NEVER flying with American ever again. I've never had a problem with United so that's who I'll continue to fly with."
Buyer beware this airline is unprofessional and if you buy a flight to any destination it is a crapshoot that you will actually get there my experience is they cancelled my flight to Mexico via Miami from Newark nj they claimed that it was a mechanical issue and there is no flights leaving the same day they offered me a alternative flight 1 day later wow now I lost 1 day of my hotel with no reimbursement from the hotel well enough is enough I contacted AA let's see what they do if I don't get anywhere maybe the court system will work so again I fly to many different destinations and if their is a problem most airlines will find a positive resolution not AA they don't care for your business also look up all the other reviews that speaks for itself 98% negative this airline should not be in business I will never fly this airline Again I hope this post helps you
"If I could leave no stars. I would. This airline has gone down the tubes. They cancel their flights, delay them and have no regard for anyone's personal life and plans. Seriously- if you're thinking of using American Airlines.. DONT. Save yourself the headache and wasted days of travel. Use a different airline."
"Look, I'm an airline employee. I get it, life isn't always a dream. Don't take it out on customers. I have NEVER been treated as poorly as I was by American at EWR and their host vendor. What I'm quickly learning is to avoid EWR all together. I don't know if it's the water in the building, but everyone in this building is angry, loud and has no business in customer service."
"WOW... we should really consider firing Ronnie. She's the rudest, nastiest, most unpleasant and unprofessional woman I've ever met. American Airlines how? Just how have u hired such a wretched lady? I've never met anyone who hates their job as much as her. Please consider getting rid of her.-a once American airline flier"
"I flew to Denver CO out of EWR. Compared with most most airlines now a days they were fairly decent both in the pocket and professionalism. The staff were genuinely working to make a bad situation (anything to do with a NYC airport) a pleasant experience. Their automated phone and online systems were on point. No unexpected fees. In an industry and location that see job as herding cows, not bad."
"Really excellent leg room. In economy class, I don't have to pay extra for leg room. I'm 6 ft 4 in and my knees aren't crushed by the seat in front of me. I'm so pleased by this that I'll continue to fly with American Airlines. The planes I flew on were the latest 737s and CRJ900 or CRJ700."
"Worst airline I've ever taken. Seats are uncomfortable with zero leg room, there are no entertainment screens on the back of the seats for flights over 4 hrs, flight attendants are rude, and pilots are inexperienced which make for bumpy/scary takeoffs and landings. We flew with a poster tube that was not a problem for another airline, but American made us check it in, then LOST IT. They were trying to have a woman check in her bag because she had a dog THAT SHE PAID FOR. American airlines is just simply the worst."

"My husband and I were flying from Phoenix to Newark on Sunday morning December 3, 2017. While waiting to board, he was feeling ill, which got worse while we waited to take off. Just as the plane pushed back from the gate, my husband passed out and I could not wake him up. I hit the call button and the crew jumped into action. Two passengers with medical backgrounds jumped in and took over. I wish I had their names to thank them. The plane returned to the gate where paramedics boarded and helped him off the plane. EVERYONE around us helped us get off the plane. The entire AA crew and staff did everything to help! I cannot express my gratitude. He was taken to Phoenix St. Luke's hospital where he was given excellent care and released. They even paid for a taxi back to the airport. American exchanged our tickets for a flight later that day at no charge! We even sat together!I am extremely grateful to everyone who was so helpful to us, and especially to AA for their kind and generous treatment. My husband is fine and I have finally relaxed. America Airlines will always be my first choice."
"They are always late, delayed among many other poor qualifications. The CEO should be fired and the name changed to DELAYS Airlines. They poorly represent America by their lateness and poor values. I sincerely see them going bankrupt in the next 5-10 yrs  if they do not wake up, update their vision and mission statement. If u r in a hurry, this company SHOULD BE AVOIDED."
"Tried to get seats on the flight from Newark to Phoenix, was told the flight was full, only single seats available in the middle, but if I wanted to pay, I could get 2 seats together. Believing there were no 2 ""Free Seats"" avaiable, I was forced to pay an additional $30+ to sit next to my husband.Get on plane, guess what...not only wasn't the flight full, it was 25% empty with may 2 seats together, including the 3 seat row we were in that I had to pay extra for, and let me share, this wasn't the ""roomy leg seat"" this was the Free Seat, I was forced to pay extra for, on a flight that clearly had available seating!What a rip off, and what a blatant false advertising, to show only available seats together, had to pay extra.When will the public get relief from these criminal practices. American Airlines told me sorry, no refund, cause I SAT in the seat!"
Flew from sfo to ewr through dfw.these two flights were the best I have had in 20 years! Good attendants good safety video great seats that recline in a slide down way so youre not laying in anyones lap and no ones in yours either. kudos AA
"Flying in to Newark Airport with American Airlines(United Airlines ) has been the worst flight birthday weekend of my life.  I flew in to this airport to fly into Montego Bay, Jamaica. I was delayed for 5 hours with any reason from staff. I was upset because I prepaid for arrangements to the resort. I missed my ride and had to pay for another taxi. Trying to return was terrible as well. I was delayed three times again no explanation(Newark Airport again) . Then I told the flight reception I was running to the restroom and I had an injury ankle please don't leave me. I wasn't gone 3 mins and they boarded the flight and was gone. My name was nevered called over the PA. They nevered called for final boarding.  I was furious!! I had to spend the night in the airport.  Anyone flying out of SDF airport do not fly to EWR (Newark airport).  I repeat if you see EWR come up switch your flight!!!! Also if you go out the country and come back into this airport you have to go through customs twice and go through TSA again as well so you have three check point to be search, remove liquids and other things (this is just a FYI).#Icriedangrytears!!! #cheaperisnotalwaysbetter #Iwouldratherpayformysanity #neverflyEWRagain #rethinkingflyingAAagain"
"Used AA to go to Paris last night; based on the next few days, my review and star rating may change.On FlightService - my flight had extremes; either super friendly or super rude flight attendants, we were delayed for 2 hours and couldn't leave the aircraft so the crew offered us all granola bars and bottles of water.Food - had the chicken entree (w peas, mashed potatoes, crackers, Gruyere cheese, cinnamon'n'sugar cookie, and salad) and it wasn't too bad; my last meal on Earth wouldn't be this, but it does the trick while travelling. Post-FlightI'm visiting my parental unit here in Paris so packed my pressies for Christmas, Christmas music (that we were going to play at Christmas dinner), and obvi necessities like clothes and toiletries. Upon arriving at CGD, we quickly learned that only about 10 pieces of luggage made it to Paris with us. We were basically told that we'd get our bags within the next FOUR days and to keep checking on-line to see what the status of our bag is.We were just sent on our merry way after; my mum told me that when this happened to her with KLM, they actually gave her toileteries etc.  Luckily I'm staying at my parents' place so I have some spare clothes, but if I were here staying in a hotel, it would suck.If I get my bag tomorrow, it would have to leave with the evening AA flight out of JFK. Fingers crossed that I can get my bag tomorrow; I love my Lulu's and UGGs, but would love to actually wear nice clothes for my Christmas dinner w the fam.EDIT - My bag has arrived in Paris ! Just got the call and it'll be delivered to my parents' place between 10 and 2 !"
"The agents here were fabulous. They couldn't get me onto the Chicago flight, so they rerouted me through Boston and got me home. All I said was ""what time is the next flight to SF?"" one woman said ""3:47pm"" and the woman next to her said ""Boston"".I was on a plane 20 minutes later and an hour after that in Boston, and top of the standby list to SF.They were nice, efficient and really helpful in getting me home.YAY AA/EWR!"
"The  Worst airline.  I always wonder if people are unhappy at their jobs, then choose to change.  Unhappy AA with bad unfriendly attitudes, make the change."
"I've been flying AA for some time now. I fly out of Philadelphia and use the airline for the majority of my business travel. Most of my experiences have been good to excellent. My last flight was horrible. I had a middle seat. No problem, even though I'me a little over 6'3"". The flight was delayed twice because of weather. Again, no problem. Thats a situation beyond their control. Unfortunately, a women say sat next to me in the window seat with a dog on her lap for most of the trip (that's when she didn't have it on the floor feeding it). The dog smelled. I pushed myself into one corner of my seat, trying not to encroach upon the person in the aisle seat. The lady in the aisle seat had no such compunction. She had the arm rest up, and she and her dog were spilling into my seat. I try to be conscientious. I thought maybe this is one of those emotional support animals. As much as I tried to avoid the dog, it was waging its tail against me and sniffing me. Whats the big deal you ask? Well, after the flight, I got into my car. Guess what? I now smelled like the smelly dog! As soon as I got home, I put my shirt and suit jacker in a plastic bag to send to the dry cleaners. I have to pay for someone else's smelly dog. I reached out to AA. Their answer was basically, ""We're sorry you had a bad experience..."" I understand the need for service dogs. However, where do my rights as a paying. loyal customer begin and end? Should I have to be scrunched up in my seat to avoid someone's animal from smelling me up? I don't look forward to future travel on AA."
"What's to say about the (currently) largest airline in the world?!?  After 24 years as a frequent flyer of them (and 5 million miles), I would say that they are better than ever.  The U.S. airways merger has gone well enough (much better than the TWA merger in 2000).  I don't fly other airlines much, so I can't really compare, but I my Yelp-opinion, AA is alright."
