"American was selected because it was the only airline that didn't charge for a carry on and personal item. My preferred airline is DCA but BWI had cheaper flights.I joined the airline club to collect miles. The web site detailed everything I needed to know about prohibited items. I waited to assign a seat because I was not gonna pay $35 - $55+ just to chose a seat. When I checked in, I let the system choose for me. I was not excited about a middle seat. When I arrived at the airport, I was able to select an aisle seat. The waiting area had charging stations in the seating areas."
"Bought first class tickets for my wife and I to see our family in Maine.  Coming back are 5am flight gets canceled. They told us we had to wait until the next day to be put on another flight.  We had to rent a car again and drive an hour north.  We come back the next day the flight shows its still on. As we get to the check in desk. They cancel that flight. They tell us they will get us on the 5pm flight. They bump us to coach, they dont wont help us the rebtal we had to purchase. Luckly we had family we could stay the extra day with because they wouldnt help with a hotel. Then after spending hours waiting to talk to some one they won't refund me the difference between my first class ticket they took from me. Stay away from american. Literally the worst airline to fly with."
"Over the years , I have replaced my luggage many times. Despite having bulletproof Samsonite cases cases that have fallen apart I now go with a full set of pelican cases or carry on only. The Inflight movies are free, which is a nice touch in this add on world we live in. I also did not know that you have to pay to choose seating on American, but it's definently worth paying.  I continue to use AA for all flights where Alaska air is not an option."
"Well this is our first flight from BWI to DFW I talked with an agent when I booked the ticket and she put my wife and I in different seats because of the COVID-19 rules. So when I booked my other flights she booked those the same but if you look at my photo o have included AA put someone in between my wife and I. There were other empty seats on the plane l, I wrote AA. The response I got back was that they screen everyone was told everyone is asked where they have been where have they traveled have they been around any sick people. Well I can tell you on the 4 flights my wife and I were on 2 out and 2 back NOT 1 time were we asked ANY questions about COVID. Now when getting on the plane we were handed a bag with water and pretzels and a wipe. Why couldn't they hand that out once in the air they still handled each bag and bottle. Just very disappointed in AA for not leaving the middle seats empty!! And AA thinks there's nothing wrong with everyone sitting together like that ya unless your family."
"Bless them all I love American Airlines and frontier they both are very good and friendly both of them they requested wheelchair for my mother in law and when we stop in North Carolina they already had a employee waiting for her no need of wait frontier also did same thing, that's one of the reasons I love it My son first day traveling when the pilot came and made my son happy that now he wants to travel more because of this pilot who made his day.."
"I would be totally remissed if I did not come here and scream from the Yelp mountain top about my experience today!!!! Hear ye, hear ye, can you hear me????Reason being one single sole AA employee is due these praises that are coming here way.  She was a guardian angle, a blessing in disguise and a random act of kindness in human form.  Today's experience was a real life translation of a blessing during a storm!!!Needless to say we missed our 5am flight out of BWI that was due to connect in Charlotte to render us to our final destination out of the country.  Upon our first check in we were informed that we missed our flight and we would be on stand by for the next flight, so be it.  We proceed to gate C7 and wait to see if our stand by dreams would come true, negative.  Stand by itself is always a catch 22 but because we were not willing to split up (there are five of us)  it only added a layer of difficulty to an already complex situation.  The gent who helped us was nice and informative and advised we were on standby for the next flight and to proceed to C3.  This is where all the magic took place. Of course, we did not get on this flight either so now we have officially missed our connecting flight in Charlotte.  Insert Tessa Letrend (I believe that is how you spell her last name, if not I know AA can still tell who she is, in case they cannot 500418, they know what that means :))  After explaining our situation to her, she went above and beyond and looked up all the future flights to find a flight she could actually confirm for all five of us on leaving BWI with a connection in Charlotte to proceed to our final destination.  Tessa the Terrific was the ONLY person who took the time to give us ALL of our options.  Of course there was a few but being able to have a confirmed seat in this case was worth it.  I could not thank her enough for her upper echelon customer service and the kindness she displayed today.  Tessa was instrumental in not only saving our vacation, she also demonstrated the ultimate act of kindness."
American Airlines staff are confused about policy and winging it.A passenger was refused to board because they had the wrong carrier for their dog( same carrier used on previous flights)-bought a new carrier and on the return flight was told it was the wrong one(having just flown eight days prior with same pet carrier)Carry-on with meds for dog was not allowed as the dog was her carry on-but the dog had his own ticket.There is more but too much to write it was a s### show.If this is how they treat first class passengers and sick dogs can't imagine how they treat the rest of the passengers.Boo to American Airlines .
Crew member made me put my carry on bag underneath the plane and when I received my bag back my computer was shattered. Went to office to try and resolve it and I was told to complain to customer services. Will gladly not be using this airline as much at I can help it.
IfI could give this airline a minus Score that would be appropriate.  If you are traveling with someone who needs assistance this is definitely not your airline. They treat people like baggage. We were scheduled to leave from New Orleans this morning and after one hour we had to find our own wheelchair and barely made it to the gate.When we arrived in Dallas there was not a wheelchair immediately available. As a result weTo rush to our plane.  We were not seated first. Many people were waiting.  Same in Baltimore.  I hope you like the smell of chemicals.  They are wiping the seats down while people are departing.  I called to speak to someone.  I have an appointment in three days.  This airline SUCKS
"I used to love American Airlines or at least I used to tolerate it. I have had my ups and downs due to canceled flights, delays, lost or damaged luggage, and just poor customer service. But I have come back on occasion because they have a lot of direct options from my home in Miami. Unfortunately this last year and a half has gotten so bad I don't think I will be flying American again for a very long time. I used to love their planes...especially when they began to upgrade their looks and add these awesome entertainment consoles which allowed you to find great movies and tv shoes and have your own personal entertainment.  Unfortunately it seems from reading articles they stopped and are now going backwards. You need to now bring your own mobile device and pay for (extra) for entertainment... oh and of course smaller leg room and comfort! Yay! Yippie! I pay more for less! But this time you guys took the cake. I fly to Baltimore on planes with no power outlets! So let me get this straight...you guys expect us to use our mobile devices to stay entertained and watch movies/shows on those devices/laptops by paying for internet but you don't give us a way to charge those devices? Genius! (Please note my sarcasm). What fool came up with this!It really screwed me up because I wanted to work on the way up to Baltimore and since I had begun working at the airport and did not have the ability to plug up there I didn't have enough in my battery to work. So thanks to your greed I had to work hours at night after flying. Thanks American!"
American airlines is doing NOTHING but a feeble attempt at social distancing i know its hard and all but if United can do it they can too. FLY UNITED.
I don't usually fly American but they were cheaper (when you include adding the cost of a suitcase and an extra legroom seat) than my usual Delta (where I get those things free due to my frequent flier status). It was good enough with an on-time arrival into BWI on a very clean Airbus 319 EOW that had the wifi's.Returning was easy with a clear boarding process and a gate agent that was clear with her announcements.American doesn't operate a huge station at BWI but they do get the job done.
"My flight was to depart at 5:15am, I showed up at 2am to check in. American Airlines employees showed up at 2:45am (TSA opened up security at 4am). Lucky (I full on sprinted) I made it in time to board the plane just to find out that our PILOT didn't show. So we were escorted off the plane, back to the gate waiting area. Like many others, I had a connecting flight. This incident caused us to miss our flights. Now they only have one flight left to go to our destination, at 8:15 am. Moral of the story, American Airlines is incompetent and should not be trusted. (Ps. The desk ladies are not helpful).Update: I have found MYSELF a connecting flight, I have to wait 4 1/2 hours for it to depart. My ride can not physically wAit for me in Orlando, (I go to school in Tallahassee) so I have to pay 400$ for an Uber to Tallahassee. LOL they gave us complimentary snacks ...thx I guess, but I'd rather have your pilot fired. This is definitely my last time taking American Airlines."
We have been standing in line at BWI for over an hour just trying to get a boarding pass. Somebody from their team needs to go to learn some lessons from Southwest
"Horrible customer service..... AA Representative  told me My purse is considered carry on luggage. I was advise that I had to check it in because the type of ticket That was purchased didn't allow any carry on luggage. It's a normal purse and how in the world would I check it in. There is no zipper and the way they tear up luggage at the airlines. She did suggest I try to fit what I can into my pockets and abandon my purse. Is she on crack???!! Did she wake up on the wrong side of the bed???  She pretty much told me only what will fit into my pockets can be carried on the aircraft. AA what do you suggest I carry my wallet, ID, money and boarding pass in. I will not fly with them again."
"Wish I could've rated them lower... there was one good flight attendant who seemed happy to help people and he went way out of his way to help all the elderly flyers. The other attendants however... I chose an aisle seat for the extra leg room being 6' tall. I didn't think I was in the way, as the first time around, the attendants were able to move the drink cart throughout the cabinet without a problem. However, the second time, when I had just fallen asleep, they straight up ran over my foot. They didn't warn me, they just rammed into me and just flashed a smile when I moved. No apology, nothing. This alone wouldn't be a big deal, but also being in the aisle seat, attendants walk by your seat pretty often right? Wrong, they walk right into you ever single time they pass. Every. Single. Time. I tucked my feet in and took the uncomfortable position I was in, but I can't tuck my shoulders. As it was a 5am flight, I attempted to get some sleep but was completely unable to sleep for more than 2 minutes at a time because the attendants kept brushing my shoulder. No manners at ALL. and to make matters worse, with myself already being bitter and cranky for being treated like an inanimate object, another attendant was using the back of my seat as a drum while I was still in it. He stopped after I turned my head, but god It was incredibly annoying after being practically invisible for hours. Lastly, the same attendant who was playing with the back of my seat decided to lunge over me without so much as an ""excuse me"" which forced me to contort my body further into the contours of the seat. I'm not flying American again if I can help it. Like most people, I like to be treated with a bit of decency and respect when I'm paying $1000 a trip."
"We got to airport 45 minutes before, counter moved so slow, couldn't check bags, then TSA opens everything we have, looking for something they didn't know and then they closed the door as we made the gate. Then it takes this guy 45 minutes to rebook. Never again American, never again."
"On July 6th American Airlines made me pay for my two bags to go with me to Miami. Upon arrival at Miami, I was informed that the American Airlines agent at BWI, and it was sent to San Francisco. A week later in Miami they call me to tell me they found my bag in San Francisco. I was on my way back to Baltimore. They still haven't reimbursed me for everything I had  to buy and now only want to pay a portion of what I spent. This is the worst experience I have had with an airline."
"The service with American has gone downhill. Not only does it now take more flights to attain status, once status is attained, it's not recognized by agents. Since the merger, check in is now done independently by the kiosk. It's a great thing. The kiosks will be set to priority check in, military or regular check in. Many times, the kiosk will have a technical glitch. Now, you can't check bags using the kiosk. It used to be that an agent stood at the end of the kiosks to recover bags once processed. That's not the case anymore. You have to stand in line. The same line as the normal fliers. So not even a priority line to check snag quickly. You are in a long line with confused fliers, fliers needing to modify travel and you, only needing to check a bag. Now, there are floater agents to assist you. Honestly, you don't want their assistance. I have flown for over 10 years and I can tell you with my heart and soul, these women they employ to assist you are the biggest group of {explicative}. I'm not sure who peed in their cereal but they are rude, will snatch things out if your hand, incompassionate.... Not just with me. Everyone. I dread flying from American at BWI because of the b-filled customer service. I did have one really great agent at the priority counter when going to Nassau 2 weeks ago. She deserves a raise and based on the lack of decorum of her colleagues, she's too good to even be associated with that airline. I wish I new her name and had a job for her. The other ladies are pure trash in comparison. Now moving forward to the communal line to check bags for everybody. You get to the counter and clearly they aren't looking at your ticket. Mine says two things: priority AND first class. So don't be snarky and ask how I'm paying for my checked luggage, I don't pay for it. It's been paid through status & class. See, this is not bothersome for a normal traveler, but a business traveler, it's annoying. Quick luggage check in would be a lovely re-addition to the priority lines. There are only a few of us and it would be no muss/no fuss. All other major airports have it and this airport previously had it. My service at the gate & on flights... No complaints there. Not one. The gate agents & flight attendants are excellent, almost always. I just wish that whoever hired them would pick comparable ticket agents. The ticket agents just seem to be the bottom of the barrel."
"We decided to book American because the flight was cheaper and we liked the departure and arrival times better than other options.Big mistake.Our flight out of Madison was 2 hours late, which would cause us to miss our connection.  The help desk in Madison was swamped.  There was only one guy who knew how to change reservations.  The other stood at the counter and did nothing but tell people they needed to go to the other guy for help!  What?!?  The scene was total chaos, with people desperate to get attention to save their travel plans but standing in a long line unable to do so.  Had to book on another airline to get where we needed to go.  Barely made the flight.  Thank goodness most people are considerate and let us cut in front of them in the security line.Our flight back from Fort Myers was also delayed.  The gate agent came on the intercom and told everyone, and I quote:  ""Do not worry, and don't rebook.  All flights in Philadelphia will wait for you.""  I should've known better.  They didn't wait.  We ran across the airport but still missed our flight.  We were faced with staying over at Philadelphia, or taking the service agent's recommendation and fly to Milwaukee then rent a car.  We took her advice.Big mistake #2.American wouldn't reimburse us even after the agent gave us their number and told us they would!!!So let's recap.  Not enough competent staff at Madison's desk to handle our problem.  Another airline had to clean up American's mess.Lies or incompetence in Fort Myers (does it really matter which?).  More lies or incompetence in Philadelphia.  I chose to believe the staff are just taking marching orders from management, so I'll go ahead and place the blame on whoever is telling the agents to steer people the wrong way.  I assume they do so to save money on rebookings.  Balance sheet over service.Obstinate customer service who wouldn't take responsibility for their shortcomings.Needless to say, we won't be flying American ever again.  I highly recommend staying away.  We thought we were getting a cheaper ticket, and wound up paying more in the end.  And the trouble along the way just made it even worse."
"Terribly disappointing. My flight was delayed 30 minutes which guaranteed I would miss my connection and I would not be able to catch another one for 2 hours. I went to an agent who rebooked me for the later flight. I asked her if she could check my bag complimentary to compensate for the inconvenience. I am given a long look and told she cannot give anything away. Even if it is a carry on which I will likely have to surrender at the gate because there won't be any room by the time my group is called?  No. I am given a middle seat in the back of the plane and went on my way. Fast forward to my connection in Charlotte where the passengers are ready to board but the crew has not arrived.  They are landing in another terminal and hustling on over to us. Also, the person calling the groups for boarding has such a high pitched voice it is difficult for anyone to understand her. Shame on me for flying on the airline offering the cheapest fare to my destination, the service is awful."
"Cabo San Lucas to PHL 11/23/19 - WORST travel experience of my life.   A 2 hour delay in Cabo, a rude gate attendant, a rude flight attendant (who also lied), a missed connection in Phoenix because they are more concerned about their on-time percentage than they are of their passengers.  Our (6 hour later) connection to Philly showed no open seats, however, when we took off, their were a good 40-50 empty seats on board.  No doubt due to be occupied by others who missed their own connections.  An extremely rude gate supervisor in Phoenix who actually tore up boarding passes for a couple who had been granted a seat change by another attendant, and forced them to take their former crappy seats.  Who also harassed my girlfriend for rolling her own bag down the jetway after volunteering it for check in.  Then to top it off, since we had missed our pickup in Philly, they gave us a voucher for a cab service to take us home.  Upon arrival in Philly at 5:30 am, we found that no such service even existed, and after unsuccessful dealings with more American employees, we managed to find (and pay for ourselves) another service to take us to our destination 50 miles away.I'm done with American.  It's Southwest from here on."
"American Airlines continues to disappoint. Their flight attendants and gate agents use passive aggressive tactics to smile in your face while holding up the middle finger. They all seem like they hate their lives and jobs. They definitely don't like customers. Customers have no recourse for airlines mistakes. I purchased roundtrip tickets and upgraded (using my advantage miles) to exit row seats because i'm 6'5"" and need the extra space. Someone my height cannot sit in the regular seats without encroaching on either side of the seat, its very uncomfortable. I checked in via mobile at 4AM and everything appeared fine with the correct seat. When i checked in at the kiosk in the airport using the qr code sent to me, initially the exit row seat was shown to me and then a message popped up saying my seat had been changed. The agent at the counter said she could do nothing about it but the person at the gate could. I made it to gate A37 and when i explained the issue, she immediately started implying that i did something wrong. She first said that it appeared i changed flights, then she said i didn't actually purchase the upgrade. She also said the qr code on my phone could have been created by anyone, implying i fabricated it. Huh? None of the Agents or people i talked to wanted to help. All of their answers were to try to get rid of me and push me along. The Agent at Gate A37 was the worst, using passive aggressiveness to imply i was wrong and get rid of me. When i found the email for my seat upgrade, i went back to the counter. She said she didn't have time to help me, the seat can't be changed and the charge would be reversed. I'm 6'5"" its not about reversing the charge, its about me purchasing an upgrade for a seat out of necessity and the Airline changing it at the last minute for no reason and thinking that money is going to fix it. Both flight attendants looked at me as if i was just complaining and the male attendant looked at me and said ""I don't make the seat assignments, so what can i do, nothing"" and then he walked away.  They want you to get angry so they can then say you're unruly and really refuse to help you. No one cared that my knees are bad and the long 3 hour flight would hurt. No one cared that i purchased an exit row seat and it was changed. no-one wanted to help and my miles that i used are gone. American Airlines does not care about customers"
Used to like American Airlines in the past now it's just not for me. They got greedy with the seats. They don't allow your traveling partner to be next to you cause they want to squeeze all the extra money. I think today is the last time time I will be flying with them today. Never again like spirit and united.
"The absolute worst airline! Definitely on the same level as Spirit or Frontier. Unless you are in a pinch or have time to waste DO NOT choose this airline. Spend the extra money for the security of Delta or search for South West, but DO NOT fly American Airlines. The customer service is horrible, flights are ALWAYS delayed, and they constantly loose your luggage. Never Again will I book with them!"
"Customer service /baggage check in wasn't welcoming at all. Such as not smiling, not helpful, uninterested and disengaged, like they had hangovers. Mr. Nelson and Ms. Nyamara.Instead of placing my bag on the belt, Mr. Nelson threw it on purpose."
I would give you 0 stars if I could.  I will never fly your airlines again.  We all missed our connecting flights due to mechanical issues.  We were told it was weather related after we were told it was mechanical.  We had to argue for meal and hotel vouchers.   Your customer service is non-exsistant.
Now I know why we typically fly Southwest. First scheduled flight this morning CANCELED. Rescheduled flight that was 6 hours later is now AN HOUR LATE. Highly unlikely we will catch our connecting flight. Wasted day of vacation...
"I will never fly this airline again!  They didn't assign a seat for my minor child, blamed me for the glitch, were rude when I tried to call to fix it and ultimately said all of the remaining seats together were for elite passengers and cost extra money. Thanks for nothing Susie the supervisor in Texas. I guess I'll explain to my minor child that money is more important to American Airlines than keeping kids with their parents. Great lesson."
"My checked bag was lost (""misplaced"", as the baggage claim rep. corrected me) on a flight from Phoenix to BWI, while in the custody and ""care"" of American Airlines. This was 6 weeks ago. Since then, I've intiated 5 calls, spoken with 9 different people at the airline, filled out 3 baggage loss claim forms, had to describe to everyone with whom I spoke the description of my bag and it's contents,  accumulated no less than 3 hours of hold time on the phone and still have gotten nothing from the airline except two apologies and a lot of blame. I was told it would take 4 - 5 months to resolve my matter (Yes, you heard me rigbt, 4 (four) to 5 (five) months). I would detail my entire frustrating experiences here but I'm sure your imagination of what I endured would not be too far from the mark of accurate. My experience has been AWFUL!!!!!!"
"On June 5, 2017, my wife, son and I were passengers on American Airlines flight #715 from Venice, Italy to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania when my wife was physically grabbed by an American Airlines flight attendant. The incident was recorded on video and I have posted it on my FB page. Under no reasonable circumstance should a flight attendant ever physically grab a passenger. The flight attendant continued to harass and threaten us for the remainder of the flight. She wanted the video deleted and she claimed it was illegal for us to take pictures or video on a plane. She stated that the police would be at the gate to arrest us, that we could be fined and/or imprisoned, that American Airlines management would be waiting with the police, that she had the full support of the flight crew, that she had the full support of American Airlines management and other such similar threats. She said all of this would happen when we landed unless we deleted the video. We chose to keep the video. We were met at the gate by one American Airlines' manager (no police) and he was apologetic and friendly but in no way does that rectify the events that occurred in the air. At no time were we ever belligerent, offensive, rude, physical, abusive or aggressive. While the entire flight crew was much less than anyone should reasonably expect, this one particular flight attendant stood out for obvious reasons. This incident crosses the line of professional conduct. I guess we can be grateful that we were not kicked-of the flight and left in Italy or beaten while being removed from the plane. Many of the Airlines need a lesson in customer service but American Airlines is the biggest offender of the group.L"
"Fantastic! I had a rough and stressful trip but not because of them. Hurricane Michael came through and cancelled flights in my connecting city! They worked vigilantly to get me where I needed to go on-time! Trip back was smooth and even better when I discovered a treat from the counter person...upgraded at no extra charge to an empty row of THREE seats! I was able to relax and spread-out a bit! On the next flight, I had another upgrade! Thank you!What a great experience and next time I fly...American, it is!"
"C1-gate agent now present.  Can she be any less friendlier?  Generally speaking, a smile and a hello from a customer who has been standing at the counter should at least be greeted with a smile.  1 hour and 14 minutes before departure, no seat and no agent at the new gate, C4, to make sure I actually have a seat.Now the agent who appeared for Gate C4 knows a thing or two about customer service.  She explained the delay, greeted the customers, and smiled."
"My husband's childhood friend was murdered last week. We bought plane tickets yesterday to attend the funeral in Miami. The security was going extra slowly - the TSA precheck wasn't open, and only one security line was operational. I finally made it to the gate right when they were about to close. Alex was a few seconds behind me because he had our luggage. The American Airlines  employees shut the gate in our face. I was LITERALLY BEGGING them to wait just a few more seconds, I told them we needed to make it to a funeral of someone very close. They just laughed at us (I guess they assumed I was lying), and told us to get on the next plane, which would get there after the funeral. The plane was still there, it hadn't left, but they refused to let us in. There were about 6 (!) other people who were there with us - thad also missed the plane because of the holdups in the security checkpoint. Why couldn't they wait just three minutes with closing the gate? The plane would have still left on time or a few minutes early. There was no humanity, no empathy shown by the 4 employees there. We asked about getting us rerouted so that we would make it there  before the funeral, but they offered us options that were prohibitively, ridiculously expensive. It's appalling how there was an instant attempt to cash in on other people's heartbreak and grief. We left, completely devastated, but decided to try again. I asked for a manager at the front desk.  Before even calling the manager, the lady at the check in desk was able to get us rerouted so that we were going to make it on time to the funeral, and without an extra charge."
Absolutely horrible. Customer service was pitiful and unhelpful. If you're looking to get stuck in an airport for a12 hour delay for a 1 hour flight choose American. Makes me sick a company could be ran so horrendous.
