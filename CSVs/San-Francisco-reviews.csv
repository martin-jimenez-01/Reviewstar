"Flight delayed for 2 hours! At least make an announcement for people with connecting flights!!!!! Finally got a connecting flight but unfortunately with a 4 hour layover!!! That means that I will have spent 11 hours total at the airport!!! I travel for work frequently and I will never use this airline again!!!UPDATE. After 5 delays and 11 hours later, I ended up going home!!! Missed my business meeting!! Didn't even bother to offer any type of compensation!! I fly frequently for work and I will definitely not use this airline ever again. After each delay, I had to wait in a long line to reschedule my connecting flight. Do better American Airlines!!!"
I was flying to Georgia from SF with my 2 kitties at 11:41pm. When I arrived they told me my carriers are too big I will need to either ask my friend to fly with me and I need to buy new carriers. The night team was rude and giving a bad attitude. I was devastated and had to find my own ways to solve this issue. The morning team was super nice and one of the Asian lady Terri is super friendly and professional. Words can't describe how appreciative I am. The managers were also super nice. Thank you. Terri.
"Flew business from SFO to NYC. The gate agent Michael was ( very) FAST!! As in row 6 was boarding within the first NINE MINUTES of boarding time !!! So fast ! In business class I was cared for by Gia who was friendly, fast and attentive. Kept the champagne flowing and the nut medley filled and within my reach. Smooth flight and the usual very comfy reclining seats. Dinner also was yummy. Thanks GIA & AA."
"Absolutely horrific.  Been stuck here in Bonair airport for over 8 hrs. AA app not working; spotty WiFi, can't call them, etc. Check in line over 2 hrs. Were given a food/drink voucher only to get thru TSA and find it doesn't even cover a sandwich- $12!!Could only promise we'd get to Miami, but connecting flight, hotel, and further vouchers ONLY known in Miami. Delayed 4 times and now a 5th with no info on when we'll depart.  Going on 10 pm. Why don't they just cancel flight and put us up here in hotel instead - how difficult is that?? DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM!"
We actually had a really great flight with American Airlines. We had a JetBlue flight coming back and American Airlines was far better in terms of organization and quality of the flight. The seats felt larger and the overall flight wasn't as cramped. Can't say it was bad at all.Our flight back with JetBlue was terrible. We wish we took American Airlines back instead but the prices just didn't work out that way.  Attendants were great and friendly. Would definitely fly again!
"An icon of the American Aviation industry, American Airlines operates extensively across the USA and beyond. I took a few internal flights with them from San Francisco to Philadelphia then New York to Los Angeles.The plane was full and yet the cabin crew were able to get everyone on and off quickly and efficiently. This is mostly because they load the plane how I wish to many other airlines would do and that is from the rear seats first. That way people aren't stumbling over each other as they pack their bags into overhead lockers. Meals on both trip were minimal, even though it's 5 hours. Juice, water, tea or coffee and a snack such as biscuits and cheese. There was only one serve for the entire flight.We upgraded to premium economy, with three seats next to each other. It gave us a little more leg room but it's not the same as premium economy on say QANTAS where there are two seats together. There are no screens either but they have installed a system where you can log into the airline's entertainment system and watch or listen to movies, tv or music. By mounting your phone tablet, you can view whatever is on. Or, watch something you may have downloaded before you got on the flight."
"One of the worst flying experiences I've ever had. Booked a business class trip from SFO-ORD-MAD. As soon as we get on the plane they said it's delayed for a mechanical issue. Fair enough. During the delay, people are asking about what will happen if they miss their connections and all the stewardess says is to download their app. The crew continues to laugh and joke as the delay gets longer and eventually tells everyone to get off because they can't fix the plane and don't have any other options. The only flight they could rebook me on was 14 hours later......no apologies. I've flown with a lot of different airlines and the American based ones are always way behind in all aspects."
"I've flown AA in/out of SFO several times and each time has been great!  I really don't like SFO at all, but the SFO-based crew has been helpful and friendly each trip!  The gate agents and the ticketing counter have also been excellent in their assistance.  I've flown nearly all the major and discount airlines over the years and everyone of them have issues... Regardless of the issue you might have on AA that causes you to post a negative review, there are many more problems/issues on the other airlines - Thus, AA is the way to go!"
"Shout out to a phenomenal mixologist at American Airlines lounge in San Francisco Calif. Mr. Fabulous is what I call him. Total amazed me with several curated drinks, not only did they look good but they tasted good as well. Kudos to Francois. Thank you for making my time in the AE lounge fun until takeoff.  Drink below is cookie crumble"
"We flew these guys roundtrip to Phoenix & had a great experience.  Everyone from the agent at the curb to the flight attendants were wonderful at both airports & on both flights.  Going there, we had a Chicago based flight crew who were very friendly & professional; Jessie was a stand out with his cheerfulness, sense of humor, & just plain easy going demeanor.  The Biscaff cookies & pretzles with ginger ale were a wonderful accompaniment on the flight.  On the way back, we had the same great experience with a different crew & enjoyed pretzles & a ginger ale.  The only problem we had innitially was checking on line in which we called customer service & determined it 2would be easier to check in curbside.  All & all, a great experience.  I would definitely fly them again.  Keep up the good work guys."
You get O stars. You have the worst service for Disabled people Ihave ever experienced. This occurred 8/10-11/2022. From Montego Bay to Miami. Your staff is rude and disreseptfull and apparently think it's funny to miss treat Disable passengers. When I arrived at MIA my yravel agent pre ordered wheelchair sevice. I had to wait about 30 minutes  for a wheelchair on the plane. When they wheeled me out they wanted me to transfer to a cart. When I said I was supposed to be wheeled in the wheelchair and why the cart the driver laughed and walked away while I wad talking to her. I was left there with NO staff whatsoever. To muche happened to even describe. I refuse to pay to be mistreatedYour website  to file an ADA complaint is misleading. The all happened at MIA.  I believe this would never happen at LAX I have never head anyone complain about their treatment from the assistance staff at LAX. FL you suck MIA you suck and American Airlines shame on you!!
"I was flying to Japan from San Diego last month. My trip was to start at 6:00am in San Diego. At 04:00am I got an email saying my flight is delayed for 12 hrs. 12hrs!!!  That makes me miss every single connecting flight. They gave no other option, wasn't remorseful about it and gave no compensation. I will avoid this airline at all cost and I am selling the stock I own in this company."
"Cancelled our long haul flight to Asia the day of the flight, though they must have known for months as they have a personnel shortage. No mechanical excuses. Customers put in months of planning hotels, visits with relatives, meet ups with old friends and days in various places, paying in-advance to have these greedy idiots cancel the day of the flight. AA just canceled and left their JAL partner to clean up the mess. We are not due to depart until 3 days later, arriving 3 days late, destroying all plans, and investments and visits with Mom. I hope JAL kicks you to the curb. American Airlines you just lost 3 customers for life. AA you suck goat testicles."
Bought a plane ticket with Americanairlines.com to fly from JFK to SFO. 3 weeks ago. Said it was an AA flight but the plane was JetBlue. When I got to the airport they said they couldn't find my flight. Neither jet blue nor American Airlines even tho I had the record locator number. I had to buy a 600 dollar ticket one way to SF. Then I tried calling to try and get my money back and of course they won't help me. ABSOLUTE WORSE!!!! Never again flying AA or Jet Blue. I am so angry and disappointed.
"Leaving thousands of passengers stranded. Refusing to provide accommodations to weary travelers when they cancel flights. Cheap food vouchers for delays of not just hours, but DAYS. Why sell tickets AT ALL if you're going to cancel the flights?I hope this terrible company goes under."
"Worst airline ever! Almost missed my connecting flight because the security line was short staffed. When I did get to my final destination at 11:30pm, my bags were not there. I was told they were on the next flight getting in at 1:30am. however our baggage claim office closes at 2am so chances are you'll have to wait til we open again at 5am. Since I don't drive that means taking a taxi home and another at 5am To come back and retrieve my bag. When I called AA customer service, I was told the policy is to lodge a complaint on our website, (this is their policy because it makes it more complicated for the consumer to lodge a complaint). There is no way for a consumer to call and speak to an AA representative. I will never fly this airline again.  Additionally,  as a business owner of a villa in Turks and Caicos, I'm often asked by a potential renters, ""what is the best time to come, what airlines fly there?"" In future, I will go out of my way to make sure they are not on an AA flight. AA is not the preferred airline of this resort."
If I could give these people zero stars I would. We showed up with our 20 pound dog in a carrier with the understanding that he could come and sit underneath the seat in front of me. Everything was going fine until an employee named Chaz showed up and decided that he wouldn't let my dog on the plane despite the pleading of my wife and me that we were relocating to another city and had no other options he rejected the dog. I'm now on a multi state drive from San Francisco to Charlotte just because Chaz arbitrarily wouldn't let the dog on the flight. He said it was for the dogs welfare. He was tone-deaf when I suggested that a 4 day drive in summer heat might be worse for the dog and the dog's owners.  Chaz just walked away from us and refused to consider the enormous burden he was putting on our family.  When I complained - not yelling or threatening anyone - the team at the desk threatened to revoke my whole family's tickets.  Shameful!  Don't ever take this airline.
"Whatever you do when you fly American Airlines do not take one of the airline stewardesses applications for an Advantage Aviator Red World Elite Mastercard. You will not receive from AA and Barclays the promised $0 intro annual fee and receive 60,000 bonus miles. Instead, you will get no miles and  be charged a $99 fee for the card. When I filed a formal complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Complaint ID: 210831-7176139, Barclays offered me 10,000 miles. What an insult!!! I will never fly on American Airlines again or have any financial dealings with Barclays again.You have been formally warned."
"First of all my family and I hardly travel and this was a first for all of us at the airline in San Francisco. If you're going away longer than a day, apparently there's long term parking way out of the way of hourly parking. Take tram okay we're at check in. OMFG!!! Check in staff you should be totally ashamed!! I understand you get busy but, signs barely explain that you need to go to the kiosk, print your tags for bags, wait in line while putting your own tags on the bags and hand it off to the attendants. They had one person working kiosks who was all over the place, no patience what's so ever, then you have the lady at the front of the line yelling a people to put the tags on and to move it, getting pissed if you hadn't attached it or even understood how to do it, very impolite, aggressive yelling, no care for first timers especially after years. My family and I will NEVER go through San Francisco Airport, America airlines every again. I just few in May with my son to Washington thru Alaskan in Oakland and they are phenomenal, explaining what to do how to do it and where to do it and get this.... they even attach the tags to the bags and then put it on the track to be taken. We stayed at a hotel the night before which was 5mins away got to the ""hourly parking at 330am"" got to long term parking at 420am, took tram to kiosks and pretty much watched, listened, stressed and cried through the freaking process. Yes there's signs saying use kiosk. No it doesn't say go up to any open one print tags/passes and then attach to luggage and then get in line to check in. After everything got to the gate at 5:50am guess what...... yup we missed our flight, luckily the staff at the gate were friendlier and helped us out after everything but check in staff you either need more training on customer service or find a new career. I've done plenty of customer service jobs and I understand the public is rough and you need to he strict but, this was ridiculous, I've never seen such stressed, rude non communicative staff in my entire life and I'm sad that my parents will never do this again. Yes we should've arrived earlier I'll give it that but get your shit together excuse my language but, I'm pissed. I got barely 2hrs of sleep with my infant just to be told guess what you're stuck til late afternoon and will arrive around midnight to your destination.  I don't if it's just the morning check in staff but, you need to get it together. Security wasn't to bad at least they communicated."
"If I could give the airline zero stars, I would, the two stars as for the excellent flight crew. This review is mainly for American Airlines at San Francisco international airport. I did not have a good experience with them. During my flight delay, American Airlines pulled me and other passengers in different directions; they had us line up at multiple gates just to get us rebooked or to give us compensation. This to me, was not acceptable. They had us do this 'dance' around the airport for over 2 hours. Thankfully they gave us accommodation for the flight but it took way too long.I was also yelled at by a staff member while I was waiting in line for the bag check to open up. They tried to tell me that I needed a new bag tag for the flight, but I was already informed by a staff member before this  that since my flight was delayed I did not have to get a new one. She did not listen. In fact, the ground staff I was in contact with seemed like they did not want to listen to me. I noticed a similar occurrence with other passengers; American Airlines walked passed them as passengers needed assistance near kiosks or during the delay. Because American Airlines does not want to listen to customers and is unorganized on the ground I do not recommend flying with this airline. I definitely won't."
"I just had the most awful experience with an agent of American Airlines over the phone today, usually it's OK but this woman particular she was awful she could not find my reservation that I pay $4000 almost, she say my reservation was canceled and she didn't bother to look as she sees if I don't have the locator she could never find it, she convinced me and that's buying a new ticket after a hangup I finally found it on my emails but she was useless and impatient with me on the phone treating me like a stupid!!Have I mentioned that I had to wait three hours to get an agent on the phone, and she was fed up and not understanding at allShame on you American Airlines to have a people like this to call a customer service"
"Met my low expectations: crammed seats with painfully small legroom mediocre but surly service confiscated carry-on luggage (two inches too long) miserable salty snacks small cup of liquid to chase down salty snacks did not beat me (yeah at least they are better than United) could have been worse (again, they are better than United) reminded me why I only fly Turkish Airlines internationally...  Sudden realization that my 3 star rating will improve their average!"
Unbelievable wait to speak to aa. They took over 20 hours to call back. Then I still waited 10 more minutes to speak with someone. What if u really needed help. My ?was not answerable online. Totally absurd. Lousy airline
"I'm done with this airline. Used AA in June leaving from CVG to LAS with a 60 minute layover in AUS. Flight delayed 1 hr and 10 minutes for whatever stupid reason. Landed in Austin had to run to make my connector. I made it at the last minute. AA didnt get my luggage. So I'm in Vegas with no clothes, no shoes, no toiletries, for 24 hours. Then, I get a call saying my luggage made it the next day. So I cab it to the airport to pick it up. $30+tip. Get to the airport luggage recovery only to find out it wasnt there and sent out for delivery. So now I cab it back to my hotel $30+tip and still no luggage. Another 4 hours goes by and finally get it. An entire day of vacation wasted because of this bogus airline. Stuff happens, maybe it was an isolated event. Fast forward to today October 22 and I have a pre-booked flight from CVG to Reno with a short layover in Dallas. Flight was scheduled for 6:00am departure. Get in line at 4:50am only to get food we're too late. SMH Get switched over to a 8:03am departure with a connector in Phoenix at 9:25am. It is now 8:55am and we havent even left the gate. So it's fair to say the connector won't be made either. So yet again American Airlines has ruined another vacation.I AM DONE WITH THIS AIRLINE!! I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST ANYONE USING THEM IF U HAVE ANY KIND OF SCHEDULE TO KEEP. They're horrible!! Sick of the non-chalantness of the pilots, sick of the empty excuses from the flight attendants, and sick of paying the extra money for AA to have a better experience. Budget airline Frontier does a 10x better job than AA and we all know about Frontier. So yeah that's how bad AA has become. U will never get another dollar from me AA."
The worst airline Ever! Rent a car before buying a ticket with this always late airline.My flight is late for 8 hours no water no food is like nothing happened My last flight with AA for sure.
"I recently made the fatal mistake of booking a flight on American Airlines to fly from Destin/Fort Walton Beach to Detroit, MI.    My flight was supposed to leave Destin  for Reagan International in DC at 10:42 AM and make a connection in DC at 2:59 pm and arrive in Detroit at 4:40 pm.   THAT DID NOT HAPPEN!  At around 6 AM, I was told that my flight was delayed until 12:52pm.   When I arrived at the airport, the very rude clerk informed me that my flight had been rerouted via Dallas and the flight would not be leaving for Dallas until 2:59 pm, so I waited at the airport  for over three hours and at 2:15 pm we were told that the flight was delayed because of bad weather so we were delayed another hour.  Therefore, I barely made the connecting flight in Dallas that was leaving at 6:45 pm.  When my wheelchair assistant got me to the gate during final boarding for the flight to Detroit, I was told that I would not be getting my seat upgrade that I paid for in advance, on the contrary, I was rudely informed that it was a full flight and I was lucky to be on it.  This is the final straw for me and my family with American Airlines trying to fly from Destin/Ft. Walton Beach to Detroit, because this is the type of travel experience we all have suffered when flying American.   I only booked the trip because it didn't involve flying though Charlotte where there is always a problem with American, however, I know now that there will always be problems flying American out of Destin/Fort Walton Beach and I will never purchase another ticket on American Airlines and suggest that anyone flying to the northeast should look elsewhere for a flight!  Airlines charge passengers for everything, there should be a way for Airlines to be charged for the needless, inconsiderate,  inconveniences that  they cause passengers."
Never ever again. Canceled flights and useless phone customer service. Ticketing agent showed no compassion and humanity for our lost time due to their repeated canceled flights. Outrageous. Consumers beware.
"Sadly, AA at SFO continues to fail in terms of customer service, communication , and courtesy. On this last round, all 5 gate agents were standing around dazed and disconnected from all other passengers  in an attempt to resolve what seemed to be a non-safety issue that was made into a safety issue. There were about 10 of us waiting for our next delayed flight asking for help but were told  NOT A SINGLE AGENT at that gate would speak to anyone until they resolved what they wanted. The female gate agents threatened to flag the itinerary if their demands were not complied with. Surely one person could be designated to help other passengers and prevent them from missing important work, health, or family connections? Really American? Is this what you think  human beings should be treated like?"
AA failed to board flight 1540 from SFO to ORD by group number.  Check in agents forced passengers even in group 2 to check in bags for a flight landing close to midnight. There were plenty of overhead bins available. This indignity to passengers is a trademark of AA. They even threatened to arrest passengers who didn't check in roller bags. Additionally they threatened to refuse boarding to passengers with roller bags.
"The Airline from HELLI don't even know where to begin with this huge travel fiasco I had to endure with a baby in tow. Strap in for the ride!American canceled our flights due to weather on 2/25/22. Okay, fine. We tried rebooking on the app several times, the flights kept disappearing and we get error messages. Call times were over 5 hrs. Finally get a call back from an agent THE FOLLOWING DAY. The earliest she could rebook us for was 3/1 (FOUR DAYS after our original departure). In the meantime we've tried rebooking other airlines, and same error message kept happening. Not to mention flights were four times the cost with 11hr or more flight times as opposed to the 5 hr flight time we originally booked. We keep calling every day between Friday and Tuesday to see if anything else had opened up - nothing. Now we're stuck in Miami for FOUR additional days - racking up costs on hotel, meals, car rental, gas, diapers, etc..Incident 1: We check in for our flights on the app Monday night and seats are confirmed. When we arrive at the airport two hrs early on Tuesday, the agent says we don't have tickets. When she reviews our history, she notices the agent that rebooked us forgot to reissue our tickets. The agent puts us on standby.Incident 2: When we get to the counter at the gate and explain our situation to the agent there, she says we have to wait, so we do. We later realize that the agent starts giving away seats to customers flying solo as they become available instead of following protocol (wait until all paying customers are checked in and then go down the standby list in order - we were the top 3 on the list). We ask her why and she says because they are in a rush and need to board the plane. That they cannot afford to wait for 3 seats to open up, they must give them away asap. Although 3 seats eventually became available, because the agent failed to follow protocol, we didn't make the flight.Incident 3: We return to the original check in agent and explain what happened. She was confused and confirmed that the staff person did not follow proper standby protocol. She rebooks us for the following day on Wednesday morning but cannot sit us together. I ask her about hotel and meal vouchers and she said she cannot do anything and for us to file a complaint. Yet another night at a hotel, missing work, school, and meal expenses.We arrive at the airport two hours early on the day of our flight so that we can speak to the agent at the counter about sitting us next to our two year old son. The agent says they cannot do anything for us and to ""figure it out"" when we board the plane with other passengers. We were so distraught by their refusal to help us that two passengers then volunteered to move so that we can be seated with our TWO YEAR OLD. It was only at that point that Victor (the agent at the counter who refused to help us) then proceeded to change our seats.AA doesn't care about families. AA doesn't care about customers. All they care about is their bottom line $$$. I am disgusted by the lack of professionalism and empathy, gross negligence, refusal to follow proper protocols, refusal to provide customers with hotel and meal vouchers when they were the ones who messed up.The financial and emotional damages they caused us were too much to bear. I will never fly American Airlines again and I hope you don't either."
"The worst airline Ever! Tried to book a ticket for my 15 years old son to visit his brother in LA and the website said to call to book over the phone.Waited 45 minutes to speak to a representative and he said I had to pay $150 fee for minor traveling alone! The ticket was $90. Never heard of anything like that before. Book flights for my teens with Jetblue, delta and other airlines all the time and never heard of a fee because the kid is under 15. Also, the flight is November 12 and his 16th birthday is November 17.Will never use American Airlines again. What a rip off!"
I don't think I'll ever fly with this airlines the way the airlines discriminate and humiliated me and my husband we will never fly with this airlines again please refund the cash Value of our tickets they people belittE me a day before my birthday. If so I can have my lawyer contact youThanks in advance
"American Airlines delayed baggage customer service is horrible! 2 hrs on hold is unacceptable. And to be told ""sorry about that"" with attitude is worse."
"What an awful airline.I can forgive the occasional hiccup when it comes to travel, but American Airlines manages to make flying hell:- They ran out of overhead space and forced us to check bags both times. They also scuffed up part of the bag - nice work- Flying feels unsafe. The amount of shaking when taking off and landing is just not normal, and makes for an unpleasant experience- There's no legroom - they really cram all the seats together in coach- The TVs in front of each seat were busted both times- And to top it off, service was curtNever again."
If I could give zero stars I would. The gate attendants in Las Vegas hub were so disgustingly rude I will never fly or recommend American Airlines. I was flying with a baby and had to change his diaper. I got to the gate at 11:01. They closed the door at 11 and wouldn't let me on.   Clearly they could see I was not traveling light. They have zero grace.  When I tried talking to them to let me on the agent said I don't have time to talk to you now I need to help the stand by ppl.  Then accused me of being late before.  I was like do you have a spy that follows me around because I haven't flown with American before and I have never missed a flight before so what are you talking about.  I would avoid this airline like the plague.  Pick any other airline besides this trash.
"The most petty, vindictive, pathetic, and people-hating gate agent in history locked the doors to the on ramp right as I was running up to the gate At JFK airport.    I had left the plane earlier to race back to security to get my iPad - that someone had taken by mistake (discovered when I sat down). The pathetic gate agent insisted I did not have time b/c I ""only had 5 minutes.""  But, I was able to make it to security and back in four minutes.  She had, however, already given away my seat and locked the doors when I got back, just to prove herself right.  I missed the flight and had to Uber to a hotel to spend another night in NYC - costing me $500 In total (ubers, motels, food). And - oh yeah - the flight was early.  It sat at the gate for another fifteen minutes after I ran up to the meet a closed door.  If the gate agent had waited 30 seconds more for me before locking the door - nobody would have been inconvenienced in any way!   I despise this airline."
Had 15 minutes left to board and then they shut the doors. We still had family that needed to board and they said no one else would be let in. After we got off the plane because we were not traveling split up they let 2 more people in. They were very rude and not well at explaining their actions.
This airlines sucks. We reserved our seats and everything ahead of time and then they overbooked the plane and removed our seat selection so then we had to pay extra to get our seats back.
"Customer service is terrible. Cancelled 7am flight in the middle of the night then they  rescheduled me for the following day, and cancelled that flight as well. I had to wait on the phone for two hours for them to tell me they would call me back in 3 hours. Refused to refund my money so i could book another flight with a different airline that was departing that day, even with flight insurance. Ended up having to wait another day and go from a direct flight to a flight with a 6 hour layover, but get this they reassured me that i wouldn't have to pay extra for a rebooking fee. Unbelievable! I was only 2 1/2 days late so i guess i should be grateful... Never again American Airlines!"
"Here we go again , a trip to Europe with a connection at DFW and another flight delay I try and get coworkers to travel AA but they always complain about their delays.   I get on to go over with me and guess what delay Traveled 6 x in last 3 months and 4 delays , one caused a near miss on connection ,  and the other I stayed in Dallas overnight AA as a platinum member for over 10 years , please do better to help me want to use your airlines"
"I am completely and utterly angry and disgusted with American Airlines. There is no customer service and it seems like cancelling flights or checking the plane to make sure it is ok before take off is the new normal. My son had a flight to Europe that he could not get on the first plan because it was delayed in coming in so he would miss the connecting flight. He had to wait until the next day. THEN, on the next day, he gets on the flight to get to the connecting city before going to Europe and as he is on the plane taking off, they stop and go back to the hangar as there is a malfunction on the plane. Now, keep in mind, this is now TWO days later and he is being told nothing they could do and go to a hotel. Now for a 7 day vacation , he only has 4 days left and missed any connections with friends when he gets there. Having to figure out how to maneuver to his final destination on his own. American does not care that they give poor service and I will promise you that we will seek full compensation for this travesty. He is still sitting in the airport hoping to leave and now I am more worried about the fact that he may not be able to get back home, since American does not do their job NOR cares about customer service. These tickets were not cheap. We have filed emails and left posts on other websites. We sat on their ""Customer service number"" for over three hours and no one was able to do anything or offer any compensation. Nothing to make you want to EVER use American Airlines again. What a shame! This is not the end of it for me. I am going to continue to go after them."
"If I could give zero stars I would, NEVER EVER fly American Airlines, they are the most incompetent worthless Airline in existence. This is my first and last time EVER flying with them."
"Everyone, give it up for the worst airline in the world....American Airlines! It's definitely no secret that American Airlines SUCKS, right? I recently found a cheap $200 round-trip ticket to Chicago from San Francisco in October. I bought it although I procrastinated for a while; you see American Airlines has a bad reputation for continuously delaying flights and then canceling them...Whomp Whomp! Let alone, the bags arrive at the carousel an hour after you get off the place, absolutely INSANE! Despite the negative reviews, my ass bought a ticket and became one of the statistics of people being totally phuckin' played. Yup, my butt was at San Francisco airport waiting to head to Chicago for over 5 long hours. Delay after delay, email notifications warning me that my 9 AM flight was delayed hour after hour. Six and a half hour long wait for $200 is not phuckin' worth the stress. Customers missing their connected flights, some having to even cancel their tickets altogether. Just horrible! Oh, did I mention that their self-kiosk is janky?! Trying to scan my ticket on my phone was a JOKE! I called one of the customer service reps, Francesca, over to assist-- 10 mins later, I had my ticket in my hand. Ridiculous! Never again, American! Then they have the nerve to raise their baggage prices?? SERIOUSLY-- honestly, that baffles me! As of September 30th, 2018, first baggage is going up $5. Instead of $25, it'll be $30. Not ME!  Smh!"
"I would rather fly with COVID lab monkeys! 3 trips canceled in 2 months and a fight for seat upgrade refunds. Over 4 hour waits to talk to a customer service rep, bad flight change notice, and clear issues completing flights. Here is a quick breakdownWork FlightsFlight 1 - Cancelled a day before the trip. (San Antonio TX)           American did not return my seat upgrade feeFlight 2 - Return flight canceled. (Baltimore MD)           American did not return my seat upgrade feePersonal Flight I already had booked 3/25/21. (Barbados)Flight 3 - Cancelled 1 leg of the return flight costing me over $1000 in rebooking fees for the same trip to be moved to November. Could not find a flight returning from Barbados for the rest of the summer. Was told a full refund was an option only to just get a credit.At this point, an American Airlines credit is like having a Harvey Weinstein fan club membership. Nobody wants it."
"After forgiving American Airlines countless times for delays, missed connections and just plain bad service, I have had it. A 5 hour delay in Dallas/Fort Worth had me arriving at my destination at 2:30am rather than the scheduled 9:30pm. Unfortunately, I had to return with the same routing. One would think one would have a modicum of service in First Class, no such luck. After flying over three hours I was given 1 glass of milk, period,  I did better in coach on Ryan Air in Europe and they're a budget airline. I could go on with numerous nightmare stories but it's just not worth it and neither is the airline."
"Every time I've ever flown with American Airlines has been horrid! They are so disrespectful, don't know what they're doing and really hate their customers. They made me check a bag that I really wanted with me because there was ample space in the plane and they couldn't give it up! I fly a lot and have never felt more disrespected by the agents."
"We missed a connection flight for 2 reasons despite having a 2 hour and 15 minute layover. The immigrations line was long at MIA. Once past that we had to drop off our bags for a domestic flight to SFO. American Airlines employees kept allowing more than 15 passengers to skip the line so they would not miss their flight. In turn, despite being 2 spots away from checking in my bags, I missed the cut off. AA managed to get me a new flight for LAX then SFO the following day, however the business class seats I paid $600 extra for were unavailable. I was assured during rebooking that AA would at least refund me the difference between flying business class versus coach. She said she would document the incident so that she could make sure customer relations knew what had happened. They didn't do so, and they also didn't reimburse me for a hotel room- though I guess that's no surprise. The one star is for the polite cabin crew."
"Flying to Tampa from DFW we taxied on runway to wait an hour to get clearance to return to gate because of a broken generator. waitwd another 2 hours while they tried to fix generator for them to cancel the flight, herd us off and send us on a wild goose chase to fibd another flight. Mind you, no apologies from anyone. My smart watch clockes 5, 679 steps from going to one flight standby to another and treated as if I had done something wrong. Not that I didnt need the exercise but I would rather choose to exercise on my own time. We have been booked on a flight now to get into Tampa at 2:47 a.m. just 14 hours later, wallet depleted from having to eat at airport and still no apologies, no assistance, endless goose chase from one side of dfw to another and very late. I will never fly American again no matter what I have to pay! Im done American and I will tell anyone and everyone I can of this awful experience with absolutely zero customer support or offer to help suffice for our signifigant inconvenience."
"My Marine came home after graduating boot camp for a 10 day leave. He booked a flight to match his orders of a return to Pendleton. He booked the earliest flight in the morning to get him there with time to spare. However, an American airline had one person working to the desk to get the passengers on that flight. We had just flown out of the same airport the week before to go to his graduation, another airline, but arrived around an hour before the flight, just as he did on this day. However, after getting up at the desk because many unhappy passengers were having the same issue, it was approximately 45 minutes until the flight. The man at the desk told my son that he could not accommodate his government issued bags because they stop checking bags 45 before flight! He showed him his orders and was told if he took care of him then he would have to take care of the others! Well, on the fact that he could even say that, there was time to make it happen! our son called us at 5:17 (43 minutes until flight) and didn't know what to do! He was not alone but in an effort to get him there we drove him to another airport and got him on another flight. I am still shocked and disgusted by this treatment of a man that has worked hard to become a marine in the world we face today! I am proud of him and very ashamed of the people that did not do everything they could to accommodate all the passengers but especially one that contributes to our freedom! treat our soldiers with the respect they deserve and more than earned! nothing less! what a disgusting company, i will never fly with them and i hope you all consider this when you consider flying through american airlines! If they can't accomodate a soldier, why would we support their business? oh, and their name alone should make them better than this!"
"This was definitely the worst experience I've ever had with an airline. I got up to AA counter at SFO to check in and the agent that was helping me asked me why I didn't just ""use the kiosk"". No hello, no kindness, and just overall terrible attitude. I went on to tell her because I was checking in my dog. And she told me to put my dog on the scale which he was over the ""weight limit"". Then she called over the supervisor who didn't seem to have an issue with the few extra pounds because he still fit in the bag. But the agent Norma continued to press the supervisor until she denied my dog. Mind you my 2 hour flight plane was about to board. And so I asked them what happens now? What do I do? And the supervisor just said call the 1-800 number and just walked away. They were incredibly insensitive and just ugly with how they treated me. I've heard bad feedback about this airline but I was pressed for time and was desperate. But don't be like me and make the same mistake with flying with American."

"This review is entirely based for the flight crew on my flight to and from O'Hare Airport in Chicago. The plane is old but the staff and the amenities provided were superior.When taking off from the O'Hare airport back to SFO we had a 1 hour delay as we sat anxiously in the airplane cabin for the entire duration. However, the captain was so accommodating as he sincerely apologized and translated any additional information he received directly. It allowed the passengers to really understand that they were not the only ones in ""pain"".The flight attendants were awesome, always coming around asking if we needed extra drinks or snacks. Sometimes they do skip you though if you don't ask directly. Also there are so many in-flight movies to choose from! On both of my flights, there were so many different varieties to pick as there were only around 20-30% overlap on movies. Also, I did have separate experiences as one gave earphones while the other didn't. Overall, I think it really depends on the airplane you go to, but would recommend based on its flight crew and amenities provided. Granted it is an older aircraft; however, the selection of movies are very worth-it. The ground crew, is a completely different story..."
Worst airline I've ever been to horrible experience representatives couldn't care less about customer satisfaction it must be their last priority I was sent to a line for security that was wrong by American airline representatives after 45 minutes waiting in a line and confronting them they couldn't give a damn in the actual flight the the flight attendants were rude which was the biggest supplies I've never encountered real flight attendants this is the last airline I would ever Recommend and I actually wouldn't recommend it at all I literally hope they close down
"Going from BHM to DallasOmg ya'll!!! This plane is helllllla old yo!!! These flights should be dirt cheap like southwest and spirit!! They use nail polish, or spray paint to ""touch up stuff"" these should be on Groupon yo!!! And lastly, This light is like a night light aka YOU WILL GO BLIND ON THIS FLIGHT light"
"Unreal!!! How does this company stay in business?!!! 2 hr delay in San Diego because the air conditioning light wouldn't come on. No not kidding. Missed our connecting flight. Barely made a later connecting flight and now stuck on the tarmac again because the ramp to the terminal isn't long enough to reach the plane. Again, not kidding, those are the exact words just announced by the pilot."
