"My personal experience with American Airline has been 5 star on every flight.The   convenient kiosk  is very easy to understand and check in .If you have any challenges  with anything there is always many  nice and friendly  professionals to help you when you need them.I love  all the amenities on their airplanes I 'm always  happy about  having the ability to charging up my electric device while in flight on airplane mode.The very comfortable seats , watching movies and free internet service while in flight is great!The friendly flight attendants  are very accommodating too!I enjoy that you can bring your purse and one carry on with you. This is with most airlines.This makes me happy to spent my money on excellent service.If you need to check your luggage there is a $25.00 charge for the first bag. I love  the service so I do not mind this charger  at all. I will  use this airline again.Thank you for great service!Gloria ~"
"After many, many, many delays to get back home at our scheduled 10pm arrival, we finally got home just as the sun was rising.If arriving at the airport in the early morning hour wasn't bad enough (with everything closed...even the taxi stand) just to find out American had lost most of the luggage on our flight, including ours. Now we get to stand in a long line for lost luggage with only one person to help. Actually I'm glad they had at least one person to help. After filling out the lost luggage forms we headed out to grab a taxi. No taxi's at this hour. WHAT!So what is a person to do? You download the Lyft app. There were only a few cars available at that bewitching hour so we just stood at the pickup spot, and waited, and waited finally a nice old man picked us up and got us home....finally.With American Airlines you will find really good prices which you have to take in account that their planes are old, dirty, cramped, and low on amenities. The flights were overbooked so every seat was full. American chose our seats for us you are unable to choose your seats on this flight. WTH! I wanted to sit next to my travel companion, not some stranger. We noticed at every gate there was a list of names on standby.I know there is staffing shortages, but come on...don't over book and clean your planes!"
"From the  start of our travel(avp to charlotte,Charlotte to denver) delay x3)until the end we were delayed (slc to ord) ord to avp.  Now ORD to ABE   Had to go to another airport and missed connection.  Arrival hopefully at midnight there. Car rental agencies are closed.   Now we have to inconvenience someone to pick us up. No reasons given.  There was no crew at the start. AND you wonder why people are angry!!  Wtf!"
"I'm so disappointed in American Airlines. I had an e-credit for $240 from a 2020 flight I had to cancel because of Covid. AA's rebooking policy is so restrictive, I lost the entire value of my ticket price. I bought the ticket on 12/29/19. If I'd purchased it 3 days later, on 1/1/20, I would have been able to use the e-credit through the end of 2022. I had to use my frequent flyer miles to buy the 4/2/22 flight I needed. The least they could have done was offer to upgrade me to first class on that flight. They ""regret"" that I'm disappointed but say they can do nothing because ""the policy is very clear."" I will do everything in my power to avoid using AA ever again."
Zero stars if possible. Been dealing with issues since 2019 for a flight. I understand that AA doesn't have anything to do with cruises being cancelled but you'd think they would be a little more accommodating with cash back or rescheduling a different flight. Never using them again.
Absolutely worst customer service ever at the check in point. I always fly American but they really need some training in customer service and how to handle customers.
"This is the very worst flying experience I have ever had, I have been a loyal Delta flyer for years but this particular trip didn't have a Delta flight option. AA reminded me very quickly why I'd rather WALK then fly with them again. Here are just a few things that happened in the span of a short weekend trip. *Emergency landing in Oklahoma- (going to VA) *Lost luggage *Text two weeks before flight and cancelled the flight I booked and instead added me to with 3 connections, YEP 3 !!! Who would book that option ? Not me *return home-text at midnight saying flight will be departing hour later, arrive at airport to find they decided to leave early again ? NO text for that change !  *Zero SOCIAL DISTANCING ZERO! all flights full, with no middle seat empty -I didn't expect that !*Heads up they will also allow the 737 Boeing planes to go back in flight starting December 29,2020 lucky flyers who don't know,  get to risk their lives riding the suicide 737 to wherever or not . (Google it if you don't know) *crew of this airline are awful- actually said ""we deal with this everyday "" , so you fly AA if you want but NEVER again for this girl !!! Yikes"
"What a total disappointment American Airlines has become. Flight from BHM to DFW delayed to the point of missing my connecting flight to SLC. Then you are given a 12.00 voucher and hotel room after standing in line for 90 minutes. While waiting to catch the flight the next day American Airlines decided to send my checked luggage on to SLC losing one of my bags. Then once I arrive in SLC I ask for them to pls just let me come claim my bag once it arrives only for them to push having a delivery service bring it to my hotel. Well it never showed up!! So I had to change my delivery address to my home in BHM. (Fingers crossed it actually shows up) So now on my way back to DFW I go to check my remaining bag and because I didn't have my second bag I was unable to shift weight (6lbs) to meet the 50lb limit. Fine no problem I'll pay the $100.00 to get my tools to my next service call, and the counter guy charged me $200.00. Once he is informed of his error he (annoyed) then voids the charge, and charged my card another $100.00. Finally get through with all that and the flight is delayed. Come on American Airlines get it together!!"
"This airline lost a tote that I had shipped that had near $3000 in equipment. Then in the end decided they had no culpability in the loss, and have been blaming it on TSA! I would avoid any flights on this airline I don't care how tempting the price may be!"
"MADE A YELP JUST TO POST THIS REVIEW-My husband and I agreed NEVER to fly this airline again. Heres why- lost our bags FOUR times. We get to the airport & our flight gets delayed 3 times. Then- our flight gets cancelled and we get put in a hotel (without our bags) Then in the morning got on our flight but when we got back to utah, we found out our bags MISSED the plane. Extremely upset because i told my husband I didn't want to check my bag because this airline always loses it. FOURTH TIME IN 4 months. Crazy!!! Have to drive 3 1/2 hours home then wait for my bag tonight (which last time i had to wait two days). And American customer service is the worst !! ANY other airline is way better. GO FOR DELTA AS MUCH AS YOU CAN."
"I've been trying to update some information on their crazy-stupid app for a while in preparation for a flight. No go. Well, I break out my laptop and have this notion that this will be the solution, nope!  I haven't flown with AA for a while and now I seem to remember while.  It's just very frustrating to pay to play their 'game' for entering, reentering the same information while hoping it saves it! Come one, put some $ into your website and app, good grief!"
I'm in a fully packed flight. What is social distancing American Airlines? Seems very high risk to me. Everybody stuffed in here like cattle huh?
Do not check your bags into SLC if you can help.  I have done so 4 times.  The earliest I have got my bag was one hour and 9 minutes after the plane landed.  One time ir was one hour and 40 minutes.  My last year as platinum elite.  Moving to delta who always gets the bag out in less than 30 minutes.   I hate hate hate SLC baggage claim
"So everyone buying a ticket must agree to wear a face mask during all flights or risk never being allowed to fly on the airlines again. I had to take two flights going to my destination and three flights coming back home. Everyone respected the suggestion and if they didn't, the stewardesses would politely remind them of the rule. However my last flight from Dallas, the young woman in 24B not only didn't wear her mask the whole flight of over a hour and half, she didn't wear her seatbelt because she sat with her feet tucked up under her body. Not once did any of the four stewardesses tell her to buckle up or to put her mask over her mouth and nose. It's not the job of passengers, but of the employees to remind ALL passengers of the restrictions they all agreed to when buying their tickets. I'm extremely troubled and concern for the lackadaisical attitude of the airline stewardesses"
They are stupid. Due to a delay I needed to have two transits and 14hr travel instead of one transit and 6hr travel from state college to Salt Lake City. They should compensate for my time and tiredness. The attitude of the AA officer in state college was completely disappointing and annoying.
"First flight with American today. Lax to SLC. The plane was delayed, the gate was changed multiple times both before boarding and when arriving. We arrived and waited an hour and a half for our luggage (at midnight!). Changing carousels 3 different times. Bag never came. Checked in at the counter and my bag had been ruined with items missing. I was then told they'll make a claim and I can take the bag home but that I will need to return the bag after I empty it at home. Yes, you read that right. I would have to drive an hour home then an hour back to the airport then an hour home for a bag they damaged. Keep in mind I've been up since 4:00am and now dealing with this at midnight after a week long business trip. I'm exhausted and this is absolutely the last thing I want to deal with. Horrible, horrible experience."
"American Airlines in SLC? Ya, you've got a few flights in and a few flights out... but you're in Delta country, AA. So when it comes to all the staff and flight options and ground support, you're not exactly seeing those chrome birds all over the tarmac.But plentiful doesn't have to mean good, and scarce doesn't have to mean bad, and American does a nice and tidy job of getting you around the airport and across the country. I know it can be the luck of the draw, but I had a flight to Chicago (O'Hare, direct, thankyouverymuch) and I had one of the leg-roomiest flights I've had in a while. I didn't pay extra, it was the luck of the draw--that first row after the first class cabin. Boy-howdy did I hunch over and sack out. Flight felt like it was about 15 minutes and we were even a few minutes early. No complaints here."
"The first time we arrived in Salt Lake City, we got off our flight directly onto the tarmac. While everyone else's bags were getting loaded onto the buses, ours were not and they told us we should get on the bus otherwise we would have to walk. On the bus, we asked the driver about where our bags were, and he preceded to tell us that they would be at baggage claim, which was about 1.3 miles from the terminal. After the long hike to baggage claim, we saw our bags that were sitting all by themselves in the middle of the floor. On our way out of Salt Lake City a couple days later, the gate of our flight was not given until about 45 minutes before the flight boarded, or was supposed to board. Once we finally got to the gate with the help of about 3 JetBlue and Delta employees, the flight didn't even arrive at the gate until 10 minutes after the original boarding time. About 30 minutes after the original boarding time, people from the previous flight were still getting off."
"Worse travel experience ever. I am filing a formal complaint for the harassment, outright discrimination, unprofessionalism and complete utter mis-use of the authority allowed by AA towards/against a passenger by gate agent, ""WENDY"". This employee of AA was working gate A1, Flight 1597 at the SLC airport Friday, May 19th. This flight was originally scheduled to depart at 1:40. However, it was delayed for almost an hour. Because of this delay, I was already uncertain I would be able to make my connecting flight in Phoenix. Since 2013, I have traveled across the globe with this ""Tumi international carry on"". Because of my extensive travels around the world, not only was I platinum on American Airlines but also Delta and Emirates. Never once in all of my many travels the last 4 years have I ever checked, or in this case been FORCED TO CHECK THIS ""International size Tumi carry on bag.""Unlike most of my trips where I, like most other passengers have 2 carry on bags, on this particular flight I ONLY HAD THIS ONE INTERNATIONAL TUMI BAG and my two cell phones in my hand!!!This gate agent, ""Wendy"" claimed this flight was full and all overhead space was completely gone.  I explained my position with my one bag going under my seat and she claimed it would not fit, which ironically it always has!!!  We went out to measure it and she again claimed it would not fit under my seat. I asked her to allow my to board and I would show her it in fact does very comfortably. She then said not only would I not be allowed to board with it but I would need to make the decision on whether my and my bag stay together in Salt Lake, or I could check it and be allowed on board. Wendy then proceeded to say ""this is my last and final offer so make a decision now""Once on board, it was very apparent there not only was space for my bag in the overhead bins, but at least 30 percent of the bins still had space and I was the last of the 4 passengers boarding. I then proceeded to talk with the captain who could see the situation with the bins. He tried to by going outside to retrieve my  bag and was instead handed bags of ice and Wendy claiming it's too late to get it, even though I could see it right below with other bags. I expect a public apology from this gate agent for her unprofessional interaction with a customer, the embarrassment she caused me to endure and the unnecessary anxiety/strain she has put me through for the next 8 hours.  She should be put on leave while this situation is investigated and be forced to take trainings in a attempt of preventing her from doing this to another AA customer. Photos have been taken to document this and I have fellow passengers willing to testify on what they witnessed. My sincere appreciation in advance for swift  action being taken and this issue brought before you handled. You can reach me at XXX-XXX-XXXXor email me at xxxx@xxxxxxxxxxxxx.org for any further clarification needed as well as how AA plans on proceeding."
"Simply the worst... They had open seats on the plane but because I did not have a ""status"" with American I was not allowed to board an earlier flight. Years back I was a gold level member and I had the same experience - hence why I fly VIRGIN AIRLINES ONLy! You can take your 50,000 points, credit card and stick where the sun don't shine!"
"They run their airline like a monkey fucking a football. Cancelled flights, delayed flights, planes with non functioning fuel gauges. Real shit show."
"I was scheduled to depart Cedar Rapids, IA on American Airlines flight 4112 on April 24, 2019.  This was the first leg of my flight to Honolulu.  I had upgraded to first class and a lay flat seat on the Houston to Honolulu leg. Upon arriving at the airport, I received a text which said the flight was delayed one hour.  With a 90 minute connection it was tight but doable.  When I inquired I was told it was due to crew rest requirements.The one hour delay came and went.  The crew arrived 90 minutes after original scheduled departure.  The captain informed the passengers they could not even set foot in the airport until 90 minutes after scheduled departure due to rest requirements.AA knew of this issue the evening before.  However, they failed to notify me.  Had they notified me I may have been able to schedule alternative flights.  However, I did not learn of the original delay till shortly before scheduled departure.  I did not know of the extended delay until the crew arrived and informed us.Due to the late departure we arrived in Houston only a few minutes before the scheduled departure of my flight to Honolulu.  AA could have had a car pick me up and drop me at the other plane, delaying it minimally.  Another person was also on the flight from Cedar Rapids to Honolulu as well.  Delta airlines, as a comparison, will pick up first class passengers in such a scenario and drive them to the other flight across the tarmac.Since AA neither gave me the option of booking another flight, although they were well aware there was a problem the evening before, or expediting my transportation to the next flight I was significantly delayed.AA booked me on a flight to Los Angeles in a standard first class seat, which did not recline.  For that they comped me 4k points.  On the next leg, it was a standard first class seat with minimal recline although I paid for an upgraded lay-flat seat.I was given 15k points for the 9 hour delay.  A delay which was entirely in their control.  Since they knew the night before they could have brought in another crew.  They could have held the plane to Honolulu briefly due to their error.  They could have informed me when it was obvious that this was going to happen so I could attempt to rebook with another airline.  They did none of those things and yet comped me in a totally insufficient manner.When I asked for a refund, their customer service rep by the name of Austin Mosby declined.  I asked a second time and was rebuffed.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and he refused to allow me to do so.When the airlines are not required to give customers notice of an issue which would allow them to potentially make alternative arrangements, nor are they required to compensate people for extensive delays within their control, completely unsatisfactory service is rewarded."
"On March 31, 2018 I was in need to purchase a refundable ticket for my 90 year old mother.  Because I was very concerned that the ticket be refundable, I physically called the American Airlines phone number to book the flight.  The gentleman I spoke with informed me that by making ticket purchases with a real person on the phone would cost an additional $25, which I agreed to pay.  He also let me know that there would be an additional cost for the refundable ticket, again I agreed to pay.  I specifically asked him multiple times that this was in fact a refundable ticket.  He assured me that it was.Fast forward, my mother is now unable to visit me.  I promptly called customer service to start the refund process.  I was told that my ticket was not refundable.  I spoke with a supervisor as well, and was again told I had not purchased a refundable ticket.  They encouraged me to file a report and provide a doctors letter stating that my 90 year old mother was unable to travel.  I filed the report and have not heard anything to remedy the situation.I am very frustrated and concerned that nearly $500 of my money will be lost from my already tight social security income.I am hopeful that American Airlines will read this review and remedy my situation."
"If I could 0 star I would. Consistently amount the most discourteous condescendingly staffed airlines. I fly weekly and unfortunately am not able to always pick a preferred airline...So the few unlucky times I've been subjected to enduring the AA experience this year I have witness them unnecessarily harass and disrespect their customers every flight. Every flight.... without fail. It's like they train to be like this. Be it culture, or faulty hiring/training practices, what ever it is AA has continually arrived to differentiate itself from the friendlier airlines by conduct only seen elsewhere in United's dragging of a doctor..."
Poor food options and no TVs in the A321 aircraft to Charlotte. Disappointing.Good price and decent connections earned you the two stars.Verdict: Prefer flying Delta. Better food and nicer planes.
Seriously if I could rate zero I would. The space is terribly narrow. You have more space in public buses than in  American airline's flights. We had one hour late delay from LAX to Salt Lake City because of ..guess what... some members of the crew had to arrive from  previous flight immediately to attend to this flight.  How scary is that... which that   flight had delay so we had to wait for the previous flightIn the airplane Captain announce that there would be a very bad smell because of some spill of detergent into the changing.The flight was  hour and half and throughout the whole flight we could smell very bad odor. I had a terrible terrible headache
"Absolute WORST customer service at this AA in Salt Lake City. Severely disappointed to the point I am considering never traveling on AA or to SLC again.Never in my life have I been called an offending term by a customer service agent checking in my luggage. And when I informed the woman that it's not appropriate to speak to customers that way, there was no apology. I'm APPALLED (yes the all caps is very deserving and uncharacteristic of me) with American Airlines and disgusted even further  by the staff."
It's a full flight and a beautiful morning to fly. However the crew seems edgy as if they just don't want to be here today. And we haven't even taken off yet. Flight attendant Cynthia... I hope your attitude changes. Tip: The passengers mood is a reflection of the flight crew. :) here's hoping you smiles-the observer.The flight was smooth. Thanks captain!
Worst baggage claim I have ever experienced. One hour after the flight and the whole plane is still waiting.
"Over an hour late on the last several flights in a row, this last time we almost missed our bus because of how late they were, my 8mo pregnant wife and I had to run to the bus stop. their planes are also uncomfortable. Bad experience every time.I know nobody really considers customer reviews when getting plane tickets, but this is less about convincing others and more about hating AA. To whoever runs American Airlines over in SLC and LAX I don't like your business, please take this personally."
"Never have we received such terrible customer service!So we booked with American Airlines for a connecting flight with layover in LA.  The time had been set for awhile with only a minor change in the arrival window, which we were promptly informed of prior; that was fine.  When we arrived for our flight that morning, though we were told that there was an additional two hour delay on top of that.  We bit the bullet, and it wasn't the end of the world.Several hours after that it is delayed yet several more hours still.  We were informed that there were some concerns about the plane itself and that maintenance was being done.  We understood; that happens sometimes.  We waited further.Seven hours have passed and we asked the employees at the American Airlines desk what the status is.  They check and, turns out, the plane has been fix for hours.  The maintenance guys could have brought out the plane at any time and we could have all been on our way...but they decided to just take an hour+ long break!  They took a break instead of bringing out the plane, that was already way being schedule!  If it weren't for the kind people at the desk forcing us onto another flight, we would have never made the connecting flight after that, and we would have lost thousands of dollars.We can understand plane troubles.  We can understand weather affecting flights.  None of these were the issue, though.  We almost missed our flight after that due to pure laziness!  We weren't the only customers that were compromised that day, either.On top of that, when we reached for some compensation credit due to these issues (only for that first flight; American Airlines gave horrible service on the way back as well, but that's a different story), the customer relations expert that responded back to us had the gall to state that such behavior and 'service' is normal, and refused us any compensation whatsoever!"
"I fly more than I care to. I usually fly United and lately Frontier. I booked a ticket on AA and did the leg room upgrade. I must preface his with I am a long legged Turd. The extended legroom was top shelf. I fell asleep no problem and may have even gotten a half chub, sort of embarrassing, but not really. I felt the whole boarding process was smooth. Except every time I fly back to SLC there is some family who lives in their own little world shuffeling around in the asile during boarding/unboarding. ""you sit here Timmy"", "" no, you sit there"".....freaking sit the hell down you nimwits! Oh yeah, anyway AA not bad."
"4 separate delays to this point. 10am flight now leaving at 5 pm. They don't seem to care. Thanks American Airlines. Even an insincere ""I'm sorry"" is apparently too much to ask for."
"Haven't had great experiences with this airline being on timeout of this location. I have had a few cancelled flights as well. None the less, the experience is fairly similar to all the other airline giants (United, delta, ect). From the boarding process, to the baggage costs and reward programs."
"I asked the woman at the American Airlines counter ""Do you know where the American Airlines baggage claim is?"" She very rudely glared, and snapped at me and said ""I don't know"". Sorry to speak to you on the wrong day woman"
