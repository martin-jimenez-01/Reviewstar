"One and a half stars! Au contraire!  They were wonderful On my way to Daytona Beach. The flight home was a little Hinky as they were running almost an hour late. That is not the fault of American Airlines. And they have to fly in some funky climates. If it is pouring torrential rain, I'm pretty sure they don't want to crash so they will wait a bit to see if this torrential rain eases up. I am not a good flyer. I always have been a nervous Nellie when it comes to flying.  The only one fault that I found with American Airlines and in fact, every airline that I've flown with lately there is no mask mandate. I wear my mask. Despite wearing my mask, I came home on August 22 and I had omicron about three days later. That was fun ((sarcasm implied)).Either get vaccinated or wearing a mask because I was very lucky. My two initial doses, and my booster kept me out of the hospital. This was not American Airlines fault at all. It is the fault of people who think that Covid and all of its variants are a big joke. They are not."
"MICHAEL AT THE CHECK-IN COUNTER DESERVES FIVE STARS. Our situation was less than ideal. We had a UA code share with Air Canada that was canceled and AC rebooked us on an AA flight... the day after Christmas... it was mayhem at ORD. we didn't even have a record locator (or seats assigned) for our new flight so we couldn't check in online. So we got in a long line... to nowhere... but Michael was amazing! He solved all our issues. Literally, ALL. Thank you for being so awesome on one of the worst days of the year for travel. American deserves a 1 star for everything."
"All too often people post reviews about their bad experience with airlines, but rarely do you see positive experiences, so I'll post one. We flew in and out of SFO to visit Napa... we really don't like this airport, it's horribly in efficient, mostly do to its tram system and somewhat ineffective signage, but we did absolutely enjoy the service we received from all of the American Airlines staff... from checking in our luggage to the gate staff to the crew on our plane, they were all friendly and helpful. AA is definitely our favorite airline!"
"I flew round trip on American with my daughter from PBI-O'Hare. The ride to O'Hare was not bad except that the plane was packed. Then they tell us we have wi fi and then they tell us - oh sorry. No you don't. Well, that's awful. The way back, the lavatory in the rear was absolutely disgusting with paper on the floor; soap dispenser broken and I had to use little wipes. Are you kidding me? They really need to clean these restrooms way more so that we can have clean ones. Not the way I like to fly."
"I recently had a flight to Chicago on American Airlines and was very pleased with my experience. I have flown with American Airlines many times and always enjoy their service. The staff are friendly and efficient, and the planes are clean and comfortable. I love flying with American Airlines and try to book with them whenever I can."
"The ground staff for AA 669 from ORD to LAX on 11/28/22 didn't allow me and my wife with a toddler on stroller priority board but allowed people with dogs on priority. after 3 groups boarded, we were asked to board. Lady refused to scan our boarding pass held us at the gate and argued. She also stopped the other ground staff lady to not apologise as she has not done a mistake. I think she didn't like to see brown people check in so early in the morning. Ohare and American Airlines as always you have proved once again that the your ground staff is rude and ra........t"
"I think AA is quite good. Our return flight from Barcelona to Chicago was canceled due to an incident at the airport. The Airline provided excellent accommodation at Hilton hotel and later refunded all additional costs that we had to pay. One less star, because of meal quality out of Chicago. Overall an excellent Airline."
Wow customer service can do better.  Over the phone service the worst.  I had a stranger yelling at me and telling me to pay attention. No wonder my dad hated American Airlines.  Both here and California we had bad service and also with the stewardess ‍ I asked for a cookie instead of salty corn  he just threw it to me like here fetch lol.  Very rude crew I get it they are tired over work but the price on the ticket were pretty expensive a smile is free and goes a long way specially when your partner is petrify to fly.  We made a world record returning home the pilot liters flew back home and cut the flight on about 40 minutes which is good but when you getting a ride home and you tell your driver to pick you up at the arrival time waiting is not a good thing next time I will pick a Doreen airlines flight
"I've been an AA frequent flier for about 20 years. I took my 92 year old mother to see her grandson for Thanksgiving. The trip involved a change of planes. My mother has difficulty walking distances and i requested a wheelchair when I purchased the tickets 5 months in advance. Coming back there were no wheelchairs or staff waiting. I had to go hunt for people. When we changed planes, I asked someone several times. No response .  I was afraid we were going to miss our connecting flight. Eventually I went to another gate and told them I was taking a wheelchair. I literally  ran through the airport pushing a wheelchair and carry on.  since then I have written to American customer service twice. I get an automatically generated email confirming my email, but have never received a response. My thanks for being a regular customer for 20 Years"
"The worst airlines. ever. A  business where I can't even stand to see a single star associated with their name. First they canceled our flight for no reason given , they then re- booked us for several hours later that same day and after we finally boarded the re- scheduled flight they de- boarded us hours later sighting an issue with the bathroom on the plane. They then fixed the bathroom issue several hours later but then canceled our flight again due to not having a pilot by this time available to fly the plane. Whaaat? Then they refused to give us back our luggage as claim they didn't have sufficient staff to unload the luggage from the  plane. Had the nerve to ask us to return to O'hare the next AM at 6:00 am to get our luggage. We got there  at 6:00 am ( after going home from the airport at 12:00 am to sleep 4 hours)and got our actual luggage in our hands at 12:00 pm. Outrage. Then, to top it off they couldn't get us on another flight for 3 more days. Insane. We missed an entire leg of our trip. We had to pay for a hotel we didn't use and attractions we couldn't go to. I contacted customer service and they gave us an insulting $125.00 for "" future flight credit "" to be used within a year so we can try them again and restore our "" confidence"" in their  airline. Are you kidding me? They should have given us $1200 for our troubles. $125.00 is truly insulting for the money we lost as a result of their cancelations/ unavailability to re book ( not to mention wasted time) . There is no way I'm giving them a dime or another try. Do yourself a favor and fly another airlines. American Airlines deserves zero stars."
"Checked in my luggage and it came out damaged. Louis from baggage services was very helpful and I'd give him a 5/5 rating for being efficient and for his assistance. Thank you, louis!"
I wish I could give zero. Dirty airplanes and massive lines. I've been at different airports all day and it's literally only American Airlines fault. They doubled my time spent in line and have wasted time with my family and friends that I cannot get back. To add on to this; there was no clear reason to why this was happening. It just....was. Nothing is more frustrating. Choose another airline!
"Not very often but have traveled a few times with AA. We faced rude and helpful staff both at the check-in area. A lot of rush but the queue moved quickly for baggage drop. Everything went smoothly, however, our flight was delayed by 30 minutes due to some technical problems while we were waiting in the flight. Not the best but the average experience overall."
"They board us, late, THEN perform maintenance. AFTER we board.  So we can all sit here for an undetermined amount of time at no cost to American. Take our money, then lock us on the plane while they perform maintenance that should have been done on their time.  And hey, way to make us feel secure on a plane that has maintenance down while people are onboard. GFY American Airlines."
Just the worst. Didn't even mean to give them another chance but I didn't realize my local flight was American when I booked Finnair for a trip to Thailand.
AA gave us two international connections that could not be logistically caught due to customs. We booked directly with AA in order to avoid just this kind of cluster.
We have a reservation for July and American changed our return to an early morning flight making our TripMore difficult. When I asked to put us on a 2Pm flight they stated they wouldRequire an an additional $2000. To move us up two hours. We have hadOn our last trip a bad experience and American Airlines just doesn't care.My guess we will never get them to make things right.I think we will switch future travel to an airlines that appreciates loyalty.
Spoke with the Advantage department and after flying with American for over40 years I'm disappointed in the response and attitude of the person I spoke with.It appears that  a Person loyal to America Airlines is so poorly treated on board and prior to boarding and by the Advantage Desk.Maybe this is how the Airlines intendTo treat passengers
"If there was a way to give negative stars, I would. The second time traveling with my fiancée and they booked us two middle seats in different rows. I tried to fix it two days before the flight with no luck, tried again at check in and again at the gate. This is the worst airline in the history of airlines and that's saying something....I'm also won't be using Expedia ever again to book flights!!!!Takin it in the shorts......"
"They canceled my flight. They couldn't put me on another flight the same day. Evidently, they would lose money if they did although they didn't say that. They would never say that. I found a flight out the same day on their website although I was on the phone with them. The reservation specialist said her system would not allow her to do that. What does that tell you? I'm so done with this airline. Let's bankrupt them by not booking their crappy flights again. Greedy bast$$$ds."
"American Airlines announced we were delayed because we were waiting for our plane to come from its hangar and waiting for crew from a different flight that just arrived. Crew is here. Now we were told plane is being looked at in hangar. Plane was supposed to take off two hours ago.....One would think the plane was being looked at before now. Apparently crew got an insider announcement that the customers have not. Crew stepped up to counter briefly, chatted with attendant and all walked away.LIARS! Who holds airlines accountable? Flights are leaving left and right and mine is now 2 hours delayed with no information as to when it has been rescheduled.NEVER AGAIN!!! I am going back to United!!!My flight was cancelled!!!I immediately received an email telling me I am rebooked for the next morning at 5:00 am with a connection when I WAS on a direct non stop. My husband booked me on a flight a few hours later via Dallas rather than accepting what AA wanted to put me on. When I got up to the help desk counter that was really of no help was told because my husband booked my flight it is on our own dime but if they would have booked it in exchange for canceling my flight we wouldn't have paid. I was told we couldn't get credited. I had been waiting in the customer service line for over an hour wondering if I could even stay in it to  check on my bag and still make my 3:15 flight.  They had 4 representatives and 2 left while the line had 30 + people waiting. AA was working the help desk with 2 attendants while the bay across the isle from us had 2 attendants working the counter that were coffee clutching. (And we couldn't go to a different counter for help)After waiting for over an hour in the customer service line, when it was my turn I asked about getting a reimbursement. I was told the customer service desk at the airport can't handle that kind of customer service and I have to go ""on line""!!!My husband called and was told the same nonsense...because he booked me the flight it is on our own dime. If I waited at the mercy of American Airlines that wasn't transparent and wasn't communicating we wouldn't have been charged for my flight. It doesn't make sense. I am recovering from foot surgery and it was a big deal that I decided to take this trip. I booked a direct non stop and followed AA's directions to get to the airport two hours before my flight. Transparency is the least of what is expected of a business. When a glitch does occur a fair exchange and fair refund policy is expected. I saw what appeared to be a supervisor walking around my bay but with my foot that is healing from surgery did not have the time nor strength to run up to him to speak. I am disappointed at the lack of professionalism by American Airlines.  My experience is not how loyalty is built."
"Terrible customer service. Cancelled flight an hour before take off. Customer service at Reagan Airport was atrocious. I also witnessed an agent yelling at a customer, calling her incompetent and then walking away in the midst of the customers need for help. Terrible flight agents who treat each customer based on whether they decide they like them or not and give special treatment to certain customers while completely ignoring others. Just Terrible. Also, all agents at Reagan either need to be retrained or fired."
"On our trip from Los Angeles to Chicago, American Airlines was one of the airline companies that had a direct flight to Chicago. We came here during April and the tickets for the round trip were about $550.00 for two people. It seems like the stewardess was tired or not very happy but I'm sure it's because they still had to work during the pandemic while people are just going off for vacations. I can't say I had an amazing experience with them but it was still alright. I got called out for having a third bag which was a clutch size bag that carried my identification and also my ticket. She spoke on the loudspeaker telling people that people need to have only two bags. I put it into my backpack and of course, it fitted. But yes she is doing her job and I get it but really when it's a clutch bag that is micro size. Just put your clutch in your backpack before you get to the counter. I completely forgot since this was my first trip this year and going on an airplane. I usually only travel with this clutch so it's easy to get my identification out. I'll still fly with them, just be more aware!"
"La'Trice at customer service desk was SO kind and helpful.  Frankly, the entire team that was on this afternoon was so nice and friendly.  seriously, I have never experienced such great service from airline staff.  Thank you!"
"Really consistent bad experiences with American Airlines , I would advise to stay away from them, especially in Chicago , filled with incompetent employees and slow customer service. The baggage claim wait took longer than the flight , unbelievable experience. Even the wait to speak to them was ridiculous, awful airline and employees"
"I want to give them a 2.5. My flight last night was delayed therefore I was missing my connection.   They did pay for me to stay at the airport Hilton and gave me a $12 voucher for airport breakfast  Was told there were mechanical difficulties which prevented flight from leaving on-time to my departing airport, had to get a new plane. Overall flight was good but would have liked at least some water. Next morning, first flight out to Cleveland. Plane delayed due to mechanical difficulties.  Waiting for new plane to arrive from the hanger.   This seems to be a pattern. But better safe than sorry. Now...each staff person encountered was beyond excellent.  They were helpful and pleasant"
"I booked a basic economy flight from IAH to DFW for our family, We arrived on another carrier into the IAH, but that flight was delayed by SEVEN hours (thanks for nothing KLM, you are just as bad as American). So while we had a five hour buffer before our American Airlines flight to DFW, that was not enough and we had to get on another plane the next day. American refused to change or refund our flights, and the guy on the phone took a pedantic tone with me about how ""rules are rules"" and telling me between the lines that I got what I deserved for booking a basic economy. I lost my cool and told him in harsh words what kind of scam this is, upon which he got aggressive and said ""is this your phone number? are you going to be up at midnight?"" So not only are they stealing your money, their employees actually make personal threats about calling your number in retaliation. I told him to transfer me to his manager, but he put me on hold indefinitely. I have filed a complaint and hope he loses his job. In the meantime, don't fly on this lousy company. They will steal your $500 while hiding behind ""you booked basic economy, no changes allowed."" Disgusting."
"My favorite airline!Why?Well, are any of them really all that good?  All the airlines have problems, so you just have to pick the one that suits you best.  I like American Airlines because I'm 6' 2"" tall and I need leg room. On most planes / airlines my knees are hitting the seat in front of me and I end up with leg cramps.   On American I always have enough leg room even on cheap seats, so I am happy with that.  Of course American Airlines has it's problems and I've had issues myself,  but for.the most part this is the airline I prefer."
"Absolutely furious with American Airlines for taking away the ""hold"" feature when booking a flight.  I am a 2 million miler and the ""hold"" feature was always one of the few things that redeems this airline.  Now, in their infinite wisdom, their management has taken away a feature that will help people navigate their plans including the upcoming holidays.  These are especially trying times and American Airlines has successfully managed to add to the frustration.  You deserve a minus one rating."
"So once again, American Airlines lives up to it's reputation as one of the worst airlines in the worlds. (Google it, I'm not kidding!)Scheduled maintenance and keeping their planes in service don't appear to be a priority.  AA is making huge profits with exorbitant fares and the passengers are getting served up some of the worst service imaginable.Come  on American, use some of those obscene profits to start a legitimate fleet replacement program! Also, perhaps giving your employees better compensation would be helpful in changing one of most poorly run airlines to one the best run airlines!"
"I'm disappointed in the way American Airlines has been handling my lost baggage. I was on my way to Chicago from Phoenix and had a layover in Austin when my bag got left behind during the layover. My luggage had to go from Austin to Dallas then to Chicago. I am currently without any clothes or any of my belongings and the airline has failed to communicate with me throughout this entire situation. My luggage was scheduled to be delivered to my hotel at 1pm and it is now 3pm and I am still without my luggage or any communication from the driver. I understand things happen, but the least American Airlines can do is ensure some communication throughout the ordeal."
"My message to American Airlines pretty much summarizes my experience:""To whom it may concern, I would first like to start by saying that my customer experience with American Airlines has been horrible. Every flight I had for this booking was delayed for multiple hours. However, the most egregious situation was the flight from ORD to SMF, where AA was completely unable to find adequate staffing (as highlighted in national news). In particular, after a multi-hour delay waiting for a pilot, the plane then reached to runway only to turn back because our pilot was ""timed out."" Afterwards there were NO adequate alternative flights for this Sunday flight with the only option initially offered being a ridiculous not one, but two days later with a Tuesday flight back. As a result of having to return to work as a front-line worker and the inadequate business practices with AA, I then had to buy an expensive one-way return flight with Southwest for over $400. I then followed all steps to request a refund from AA and was refunded an inadequate amount that was not even half the original flight cost and far less than the return flight I was forced to purchase. I am writing to once again request a full refund on this horrible flight experience given involuntary cancellations due to staffing issues, inadequate alternative flights, and multi-hour delays. American Airlines you greatly need to step it up, the service has been truly terrible. I have advised many to NOT fly American Airlines ever and have also expressed this dissatisfaction on social media. My attempts to reach customer service have been abysmal with 4+ hour delays or scheduled calls only available at 10:30pm (where the representative then says the team I need to talk with is only available at 8am-12pm)."""
Pathetic. On a layover in chicago .Screwed us around for over an hour before finally telling us our flight is cancelled do to lack of crew. They want us to wait at the airport for 3 days or the next available flight ...whats...that's absurd. Telling us no comps.no refunds and no car rental assistance . Southwest sucks but they are better than american air. No refunds when it's a lack of employment problem ..that's 100 percent their fault and they dont care.  Never fly american air ..I never will again.. definitely fing a lawsuit to get my money back and more this is ridiculous .I'm on an injured knee and they have had me WALK across this airport several times these people they hire are all crap ...DO NOT FLY AMERICAN AIR
"One of the more impressive flagship lounges I've ever seen. Beverages: The fully stocked wine, beer and liquor is out of this world. If you can't find a drink you like then you are too picky! There is a huge cooler full of different bottled beers. Huge counter full of top shelf liquor. Self-serve! I had a hankering for a crisp rose wine and I found one. They also had champagne/sparkling wines. Fancy marbled counters. Servers everywhere cleaning up dishes. Food: amazing selection of food. I was not super hungry but I grabbed a few pieces of sushi, cheese cubes, and those amazing home cooked cheddar potato chips. My husband even got a piece of quail which he said was amazing. Lounge: modern, well-lit, fancy, and super quiet. Comfortable seating everywhere. Plenty of outlets for charging your devices. Beautiful and clean bathrooms with nice organic hand soap and lotion. I didn't see a shower but found out later you had to ask for a key. Probably my favorite part of traveling and I look forward to O'Hare now!"
"You know, I can be tough when rating airline lounges, but I must say this Flagship Lounge was redeeming. Highlights:-Food: This Lounge has the best food selection of any Flagship Lounge I've seen. It's not the Air Canada Signature Suite in Toronto Pearson, but it is much better than most lounges. I was here for both breakfast and lunch service. For breakfast, the pancakes, scrambled eggs, and chilaquiles were all pretty good. For lunch, I stopped when I saw the racks of lamb. AA never offers lamb in their lounges! It was accompanied by a nice chimmichurri that was not overpowering. There is also a sushi bar, dessert bar, and proper bar. -Space: The lounge is decently large and has two sides that are more or less the same, although if you walk in and go to the right and straight down, there is a little relaxing room where you can try to grab some shut-eye. The showers aren't obvious, but they do have showers and you can ask the agent for a key. It's also very well lit here, which is nice, and the windows give you a wide airside view. There are ample power outlets--and they work and aren't falling out of the wall like some AA lounges *cough Miami D15 cough*. -Noise: The Lounge started to fill up around 11 AM but it was not crowded, and it always had a relaxing, quiet environment. Nothing like the Flagship at LAX, which is like a club in Atlanta with how many people are in there sometimes. -Staff: Loads of people are always coming around to clear plates, etc. Friendly folks. This is perhaps the best Flagship I've been to in North America. There are a few little touches--like the mojito bar they have sometimes at LAX, or fresh omelettes, but this was definitely a comfortable place to spend four hours and get some work done! 4.5"
