"I flew from Orlando to Philly and back.The fight was not bad. The crew was friendly.The plane was clean and new. Thank unfortunately my checked bag was damaged on the flight back.American asked me to return to the airport and drop the bag off to be sent out for repairs. This is not helpful at all.They will mail you a shipping label if you don't want to go to the airport again.If you have time, this is better:I need the bag repaired quickly. That means an unwanted trip to the airport. I will also have to mail in my parking stub to get reimbursed. This is very poor customer service to say the least.Won't use American for a long time...Be careful with these clowns..."
Never had any good experiences on this airline.    Always flew DELTA in the very recent past UNTIL they expired all my frequent flyer miles during the Great Covid Depression.   Still burned up about that.  Now I'm flying American ... doesn't mean I want to.
"Where do you begin?  Is American Airlines (AA) the same as it was prior to Covid? No! Is any Airline? I do miss the the blanket being tossed on you on the cool night by the stewardess on a half empty flight, or the hot meal when traveling cross country but those days are gone. Admit it with all the Internet Travel sights where's our loyalty to the Airlines.  We choose the best bargain on Orbitz. If AA is the one we select that's the one we use.Today whatever Airline it is, it is going to be will be 100% full, minimal trills for free, and have cancellations due to today's workforce not wanting to work.Now my experience on my recent trip from Orlando, Florida to Anchorage, Alaska on AA.  On the Orbitz web sight they were the best deal.  The plane left on time, I received a free coke on the plane, the pilot thanked me when I exited the plane and my luggage promptly appear in the baggage area, even after I had a brief layover in Dallas, Texas.I am sure I will be using American Airlines again in the future."
3-23-22American Airlines you are so not deserving of your current low rating in Orlando which is currently at 183 reviews at 1.5 stars. I arrived early to the airport and went to the Priority desk located on the lower level to get an earlier flight. The gentleman at the counter quickly went into action. Not only was I moved up to a flight that left an hour earlier but I even got a better seat on my preferred aisle closest to the front of the plane. When I questioned if there was an even earlier flight he very logically explained that given the time to get through security  I wouldn't make it. He was spot on with his reasoning. I was very glad to get in an hour earlier and also note this was zero cost to myself so a Win Win situation.
"Completely disappointed, our first time flying American Airlines was a complete disaster. First of all, they delayed our flight and we had to sit on the runway for hours for absolutely NO reason. This caused us to miss our connection. To our inconvenience, we had to fly to another location and drive to our final destination. Then we got to the airport and noticed that we were missing two of our suitcases. The American Airlines staff at the gate stated that they will be moved on the fight that we had to take due to us missing our connection, but they didn't. Again, I am disappointed because they took NO accountability at all."
"Let says that's my last experience with the trip wasn't the best, we missed our flight twice and because of the covid pandemic a lots of things went wrong, now my 5 star is for the AA employees in the  check in counter, the line, and the gates here in MCO. They were really helpful and kind even when we were having difficulties out of our control checking in a international flight. in that sense I would 5 stars for their excellent customer service in the counter and check in"
This airline is the worst.  Last time I was in Orlando going to dc 5 minutes before boarding time the flight was canceled. Today I'm supposed to leave at 5:45. NOW THEY CHANGED IT TO 6:40.This airline doesn't care about it's passengers at all. There is no reason why the flight was charged
I fly 3-5 times every week and have during the entire Covid process & it still shocks me when I fly with American that they always oversell every flight by close to 20 seats.  Every flight it's this way & it's just getting worse.  I don't understand how that happens and why they continue to let it happen. I fly delta weekly and it's never like this as well as southwest and United.
"Absolutely the worst. I try and avoid American airlines when every I can. They blamed the weather for the last 2 flight I was on with them. The last time I flew with them they left us  stranded in Dallas Fort worth. We had to fly to Tampa and rent a car to go to Orlando airport to get our bags and pick up our car. Now I have them another chance and once again getting the run around. Our flight out of Orlando to Philadelphia has been delayed and not sure we will make our connecting American flight to Italy. The lady at the service counter was very nice and tried to help by moving us to the front of the plane, and tried to change our international flight in hopes to get us to Italy before our cruise ship departs but no luck.Now it's just a waiting game.Update had to re schedule do to delays. Had to cancel cruise still try to rebook so it not total lost. Thanks again American airlines for remember trip. I pray I never have to fly the crappy airlines again. Its a shame,  because I had the utmost respect for this airline for not taking the bail out."
"Horrible.  They boarded all of us on time, THEN made an announcement about a problem with the plane's braking system that they'd been working on for a while at that point.  After about 45 minutes they told us it'd be another hour before the problem would be fixed, and they ordered everyone and their luggage to get off the plane.  Meanwhile, passengers were getting texts from AA every 15 minutes, delaying the takeoff time by 15 minute intervals when they'd already told us it'd be another hour.  Many people were asking why they bothered to board us in the first place when they knew the plane was broken, as we at least had A/C and WiFi in the terminal.Once the problem was fixed, the staff were pretty rude when making announcements during the re-boarding process.   When this flight finally arrived at the final destination, the flight attendants were yelling over the PA in a rude manner: ""CLOSE THE OVERHEAD BINS AND SIT DOWN!  THIS IS AN FAA REGULATION!!   WE WILL NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO DEPLANE UNTIL EVERYONE IS SEATED!!!!""  What they failed to appreciate is that probably 1/2 the plane full of people needed to RUN to try and make their connections due to AA's broken plane and the flight delay it'd caused.While I realize planes break and maintenance issues happen, this one was handled really poorly from start to finish."
"Looks like AA here at Orlando Airport has a crappy 1 1/2 star overall rating, but for me on this day, they were fine.   I'd already checked in and printed boarding passes so I didn't need to deal with their ticket counter here, I had no checked bags so I didn't need to deal with baggage claim, and my flights into and out of MCO boarded nearly 30 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time and took off on time.Compared to my typical experiences with this Airline a few years ago, which never earned good marks from me and were fairly crappy for one reason or another, both experiences on this day were ""A-OK"" as 3 stars on Yelp denotes.  Keep it up, AA!!"
"WORSE AMERICAN AIRLINES BRANCH OUT THERE.My family & I arrived at the MCO Airport on 4/16 at around 4am to check in for our 6am flight back to Los Angeles. We were traveling with a pet so we had to wait in the international line which was really long. My dad looked to speak to a manager to see if we could accommodated any way so we wouldn't miss our flight. He told me the manager's response was ""well you should have gotten here at 3am"", which was very rude. After an hour of making line, we made it to the rep to check in our belongings, I asked the manager my dad spoke to for her name and she refused to give me her name and asked me ""what do you want my name for?"" in a rude manner. I had to read the manager's name tag because she wouldn't give me her name when I originally asked. At first, I read the name Tracy but she corrected me and told me her name was Stacy. I explained to her i wanted to report her to corporate for her rudeness towards my dad and even asked for the corporate number but she refused to do give me any information. Instead, Stacy began yelling and point fingers at my 15 year old sister claiming she was recording her so She said that we did not have permission to record her, therefore, she canceled our flights. She asked us to leave but I refused because she did not give us any refund for our flights, she only said she banned us from traveling with American Airlines. She to call the cops because we wouldn't leave& when she asked my. nationality and I chose not respond to her, Stacy assumed my nationality and she told the police ""you know who they are when you see them"" or something around those lines. I then pulled out my phone to record her because she was telling one of her subordinates in front of us ""it's funny that they think they can talk to you any way they won't like if we won't do anything about it"" and they laughed in our faces. She then took out her phone and began recording me but stayed quiet all of a sudden. Eventually the cops came and asked us to leave and we were forced to purchase tickets for a later flight with United Airlines.Your manager, Stacy, was overall unprofessional and rude. It made my sister feel uncomfortable having a grown older woman point fingers and yell at her, especially for no apparent reason. Stacy made my dad feel unwelcomed when he only asked if she could accommodate us in any way. It was very unprofessional of her to say ""well you should have gotten here at 3am"" when she could have simply said ""I'm sorry there's nothing we can do"". As a manager, when someone asks for your name, you are supposed to give your name. Stacy refused to give me her name from the moment I asked and I believe it's because she's already been receiving complaints from other passengers there for how disorganized Stacy kept the check in lines so she didn't want to get in any trouble. On top of that, she remained rude and disrespectful to me and my family by arguing with us and pointing her fingers at us and laughing in our faces.Im unaware of your policies but when asked for a refund, after Stacy canceled our flights, she said to go to the AA website. I don't understand why she couldn't give us the refund right there and then, the same way she canceled our flights right away. I don't believe she should have the right to cancel our flights based off assumption of my sister recording her or not (WHICH IS LEGAL BEING THAT WE ARE IN A PUBLIC PLACE). We flew to MCO from LAX on Saturday 4/9 with American Airlines and our experience in LAX was far more pleasant than the experience we had this morning at MCO all due to the interaction we had with Stacy. I believe the poor customer service she provided was racially motivated because I have NEVER had trouble flying with American Airlines until today. Stacy should be demoted from her position as manager because I too worked as a manager at an airport before so I understand the  importance of quality hospitality, which Stacy clearly does not. Her hospitality skills were far below adequate and she should be embarrassed to claim the title as a manager with that attitude. I hope she is held responsible for her horrible hospitality as a manager, whether it be some form of discipline or termination."
"American Airlines at Orlando Airport is a mixed bag.  The ticketing area is super nice and open, but you can't find where to enter the line to check your bags.  There's usually so many people there, that finding the opening in the ribbons is a challenge.  They need better signage.Once you figure that out, checking in and checking your bag is pretty straightforward.  I'm guessing they're more strict with their ""overweight"" bag policy as many people were off to the side rearranging their luggage.  Keep that in mind if you're checking a bag.There were some curbside check-in desks outside but didn't have tip money available so I went inside.The terminal itself can use an update.  It's cramped, crowded, and not a fun terminal to get to your plane.  I'm sure some of that is the airport, but American can do their part to provide charging stations, etc.  The Southwest Terminal is a dreamland compared to the American one.They got me to where I needed to go, the people are friendly, but I think they could improve getting people around."
The worst organization on planet Earth. They cannot do anything right. Please do not waste your money on this airline so it can finally just rollover and die.
"So sick of delays, cancels, last min changes and a loyalty program that is really bad."
"Only Bec there is no option to give zero stars. Missed my honeymoon, no compensation, hours on the tarmac, no food, no water; given only apologies, which I cannot eat or spend on hotels or buy back my time , which I've had to purchase Bec of this stupid debacle. No one can do anything apparently and no one has answers. Or food. People who checked bags couldn't find them and literally no one knew where they were."
"They canceled our flight out of nowhere and my husband is missing work and we nearly have money left for a hotel and  what a freaking problem they have caused an issue between us now he is so angry he says he never wants to travel again. Also we just had upgraded our seats this morning, I hope they refund him. I'm so upset. Our travel experience got ruined."
Love flying with y'all!Clean Organized Friendly-flight attendant was so nice when we had turbulence Understanding (changed my seats Bc baby seat was her by herself)Didn't charge for luggage Bc it was barely not small enoughIt's the small things people!!! Thank you!
"Not too happy with American Airlines out of Orlando. They initially told us that there was a delay due to them cleaning the plane thoroughly. That turned into there is a maintenance issue that delayed the flight 40 minutes, then 2hrs, then 3hrs, then flight got cancelled. Thankfully my wife was able to call in and get us booked on the last flight out that evening. And we were able to get the exit row. If not, we would have to fly out on the 6:20am flight the next morning."
Rafael and the other worker there were sooooo rude for no reason! our flight was delayed causing us to possibly miss our layover. he told us we would have to stay an extra 2 days with no apology no sympathy . i get it was a weather delay but we got delayed already in the way here and felt like we should at least be compensated for hotel rooms. instead he treated us rudely and blamed us for changing our flight a couple days ago. thanks so much american i will never fly with you again and i'll make sure anyone else i know doesn't . thanks for stranding us two young girls in an unknown state!!!
"Worst airline by far.  Terrible service, zero communication, delays for no obvious reason."
"Worst service ever. They do not care if you have to be somewhere, nor do they care if you've waited all day and kept cancelling your flight. My flight plus 400 people's flights got cancelled. No one could come tell us what to do, they just had us wait in line for 5 hours. So I left. This is the most shitty airline I've ever experienced. This was just my trip back. My trip to the place I was going was also messed up, causing another 4 hour layover. Never fly with them."
"I took a flight from Orlando to Charlotte, NC on American Airlines and the flight was on time.  This is yet another on-time flight from American and that is really saying something.  In recent years I was one of the first people to talk about American when the flights were routinely falling behind schedule.  There were countless times in the past when I found myself and other trying to busy ourselves while waiting for late flights.  It seems like American may have finally gotten their act together.  In recent months, I have had several on time flights so I have to give them credit where credit is due.  The flight experienced a bit of turbulence but the pilot advised us that he was going to take the plane up above the rain clouds.  He did it and then the flight was smooth sailing for the remainder of the time into the Queen City and we landed on time."
I'm here at the Orlando American Airlines departure area at Gate 39.  Very slow and bad service. AA needs to train their staff customer service.
"Horrible!! NO COVID SAFETY!!! Do not fly this airline if you want anything closely related to covid safety!!! Please believe me. I did not look at the reviews and I wish I did they are spot on! This airline has zero social distancing measures. They pack the planes, sit you next to a virtual stranger the entire flight  I was unfortunately in a middle seat and my anxiety seated there the entire flight was insane. Please do not trust anything they say publicly it's all BS!!   SHAME ON YOU AMERICAN! AIRLINES YOU DISGUST ME HOW DARE YOU PUT PEOPLES LIVES IN DANGER WHEN A SIMPLE PROTOCOL OF AT LEAST TEMPERATURE CHECKS BEFORE BOARDING WOULD HAVE GIVEN EVERYONE PIECE OFMIND!! All the parks in Orlando provide temp checks to every guest that's 1000''s vs you having to take them for only 100 +\- each flight"
I had a very bad experience with American Airlines on December 23rd at MCO. I am handicapped with stage 4 cancer and on oxygen.  They could not get me to security with a TSA pre check so I ended up pushing the wheel chair myself. I spoke with a supervisor at the gate and I thought I would hear from them. Still haven't. I'm thinking maybe I need to speak with someone on the board of Americans with disabilities. They insist on pushing 2 wheelchairs a lot of the time which I don't feel is very safe. Anyway just thought someone should care.
"They claimed the airport was CLOSED. Not true. While American closed their ramp due to lighting, Delta and Southwest both had planes taking off. Gate agents continue to lie and mislead passengers with the LIE that the airport is closed. The lack of info and out right lies may be accepted by others, but tonight's performance is an embarrassment and injustice to all American Airlines passengers."
"We had our flight cancelled about an hour before our flight. Then, when we tried to get in contact with the airline, we were put on hold and hung up on multiple times. Would not recommend flying with this airline."
Every connecting flight appears to be delayed. No reason given. I hate traveling by air unless distance is too far. They screwed up my last two flights and now my girlfriends flight. The seats suck. Small seats. They gave up on meals. No more blankets. Damn I'm pissed!!
"I arrived to the MCO airport at 4:20 am for my 6:05 am flight just to be informed American Airlines systems are down and we would need to wait in a line (workers unsure as to which line is which) and directing flyers to the wrong line. After waiting roughly two hours before the systems are back up and the lines start to move, get to my gate and board approximately 6:35/6:45 am. The flight doesn't take off until about 7:20/7:30 am and arrives to Charlotte, NC 8:50 am give or take. By the time I get off the plane (8:58 am) and walk 100 miles to get to the connecting flight, my flight has taken off (on time 9:05 am) knowing the delays from arriving flights due to ""system security issues"". This Airline did nothing to accommodate flyers for their inconvenience but instead add me to a stand by flight for the next one leaving. Just to be told 45 mins prior to that flight boarding that the gate changed and that I will probably have to be on stand by again for a later flight making my travel day about 12 hours in the airports for something that should have only taken 4.5 hours. I recall Southwest waiting for the passengers arriving late from their delayed flight to make sure they connected. I would not recommend this airline. Poor customer service and consideration for paying customers. No apology offered at no point!Adding to my review 5/24/21...Scheduled to return to MCO with American; department time 6:20 pm. Received a text at 2:00 pm that my flight is delayed until 9:28 pm. Received another text 2:28 pm that due to delay, I'll miss my connecting flight so my flight was changed to 5/25 at 12:15 pm. Asked to confirm or change flight. Never informed as to why my flight was delayed hours prior to the flight. Now this airline again inconvenience my personal schedule with getting back home and back to work. Airline completely ridiculous!! Awaiting for airline to again mess things up tomorrow for rebooked flight. ‍"
"Arrived for my flight 2 hours early.  The only line at the whole airport was at the AA counter and it was so long it wrapped in numerous circles around their area.  Why you ask?  Because their self check-in machines were out of paper and they didn't have any refills.  Oh yeah, and despite having about 8 counters, they only had 3 people working.  2 hours of waiting in line later and after my flight was already gone, they started having people from the back of the line move to the front.  Worst company ever.  Oh yeah, they also have a lot of Boeing airplanes as well which have been known to crash."
"This review is strictly based on my experience at the AA baggage claim office staff in Orlando. I rarely fly with American Airlines, for no other reason than my carrier of choice has been United since they merged with Continental a few years ago. Having missed a connection at IAD to MCO the day before I ended up getting booked on a AA for my return flight and my luggage remained with United so my challenge was to locate my luggage once I finally made it back to Orlando. The United staff here provided little to no help locating my bag even though it was still in their system and had absolutely nothing to do with my flight on American, but I was told the airlines baggage claim systems were shared and I would have to deal with AA to get my luggage.The AA baggage claim staff immediately began the search for my bag after I provided them with my claim check and flight information. After a few minutes she was able to locate it on an inbound United flight and offered to have my bag delivered to my residents once it arrive at no charge even though I live about 74 miles from MCO and AA had no responsibility for my missing luggage. Once she took all my contact information down she assured me they would communicate  during the entire process until my bag was back in my procession (I received a total of 4 emails and 2 phone calls just as she promise).As I exited the AA baggage claim office getting ready to drive home another AA employee stopped me after hearing my dilemma and assured me they would recover and return my bag as soon as possible and then walked over to the United baggage claim area with me to double check that my bag hadn't arrived and been placed in the United boneyard of unclaimed luggage. This gentleman was a 30 year employee of AA and his customer service skills were incredible especially since AA had no skin in the game. At the end of the day my luggage was returned to my home and a follow-up email was sent checking to make sure all was well - this kind of customer service will not go un-rewarded - thank you American Airlines..."
They delayed my first connection flight so their crew can take a nap which will make me miss my connection flight and i had to land at a strict time because I have class and now everything is all over the place. Never flying american airlines again!!
"Ugh they don't even deserve one star but I will give it to the lady at the counter who checked us in, but omg!!! The OLD lady who works for American airline needs to common courtesy or take some lessons for hospitality!! We have the military id's and we do get the free baggage we showed our id to her but she said it's not free for veterans or reserved and she was giving us the biggest attitude considering i have a baby got all these bags with us, my husband asked why because we just wanna know for future reference because UNITED AIRLINES do it whether you're active duty or veterans and that OLD RUDE LADY SAID its only for active with the biggest attitude ughhhh i wish we got her name or something so we can report her because thats not how you react with guest especially they paid."
"The Orlando American Airlines gates seem to be oddly lacking when compared to other American Air gates in different airports. They have only a handful of plugs, very limited seating in general, and it's not always clean in the gate area.I've flown from American Air several times at this airport and it's always the same. There are roughly 50 seats in each gate area, and the planes hold 100+ people, so you can see how that math won't work, especially if the gates next to your boarding gate are loading around the same time. I've never needed anything much from the customer service counters, however, you'll want to note that more than 50% of the time you'll be forced to check your carry on as they always run out of room in the overhead bins. This is the constant, and they do nothing to change it, which is frustrating for business travel, as it eats my time on the flip side to wait at a bag claim that I didn't want to wait at...defeats the purpose of carry-on option. At least they check it for free.Overall: C-Eh, I've experienced better from other American Air locations at different airports."
"They need an action plan when planes get delayed or cancelled.  It's not like it never happens and as someone, who paid over $525. to transport our pets.  Please let us know what's going on with them.We returned + got Glenn again.  I know it was a pain for him bc there is so much paperwork with animals.  But he is still SO nice + thoughtful!  He definitely deserves a raise!"
"Glenn and his co-worker were very patient and detailed.  They sincerely wanted to make sure our animals were taken care of.  We are traveling with multiple animals and he was thorough and helpful!  He made sure we had no problem getting on the plane and dealing with TSA.  Sadly, our plane had mechanical problems and we had been re-scheduled, which was a horrible experience.  It involved waiting in 2 separate customer service lines with everyone on the plane.   We all missed our connecting flights + some had connecting flights to islands, to Europe or on cruises.  We were in chaos + American Airlines did not have enough Glenns on hand to help.  We just got shuffled from one line to another.  I would say that it was good we got comped for room and food.  But it's nerve-wracking for two to travel with suitcases in one area, animals in another + re-scheduling lines in another.  We started this journey at 6 am and didn't leave until 2 pm or so.  It was not a fun memory, but Glenn made it better!  That's why I gave them 2 extra stars bc of Glenn.  They need more ppl to be like Glenn versus passing us off.  The Admiral Club were really snotty to all the poor ppl on the plane, who were confused + struggling.  I heard them tersely say, ""We aren't here to help you.  You guys have to go to customer service.  We only help Admiral ppl.""  Be more like Glenn should be the motto, actually treat ppl kindly versus like nuisances."
"What was once a decent airline is now worse than bottom feeders like Frontier and Spirit. Have been waiting a total of 5 hours to take off for a two hour flight. Had us deplane after the first hour and a half only because that had to. Then had us wait in the terminal for another hour plus, re-board and sit in the plane for another hour. Just cancel the damn flight. This once decent airline has now sank to the bottom of the trash heap of money grabbing, poor customer service and an attitude of not caring for the customers needs or comfort."
"American Airlines was one of our top choices when we decided to vacation to Orlando, FL.  So after we arrived at the Orlando International Airport to begin our fun filled, whirl wind vacation in the great tourist spot of Orlando, our limo driver was already there waiting for us in the AA baggage claim area.  We had to walk swiftly through the facility and down the escalator to get to our luggage.  Only to discover after a long waiting period of staring at other people's bags riding around the conveyor belts, that our luggage did not arrive with us.  After asking for help, we were directed to the baggage customer service office.  There was one guy ahead of us who was going through the same thing.  When it was my turn, she was very nice and patient as she made a search into their computer data base.  Apparently our luggage went to Charlotte, NC.  She printed a ""Delayed Baggage Receipt"" and told us that our things would be delivered to our vacation condo later that evening.  She also stated that the luggage fee we paid of $50.00 would also be refunded for the inconvenience and to watch for this in my e-mail.  I know that this airport was not responsible for our lost luggage, but I want to acknowledge that this staff member in particular (who's name I didn't get), did a great job at reassuring me that we wouldn't have to worry about our all important missing stuff.  That was a job I couldn't do, especially when dealing with the business of irate customers.  Our bags did arrive as promised. 12 days later, we once again had to return to the Orlando Airport to go through the check-in process and arrange our flight back to Sacramento.  The lines were long at the American Airlines area.  When our turn arrived, the check-in process went smoothly as the female staff member handled us in a friendly and efficient manner.  In a complete turn around, we went upstairs to get our tickets confirmed by a rude and abrupt woman who seemed to hate people in general who just waived us through without a word.  Then, when we proceeded to the security area, a man seemed to share the same hatred, as he shouted at the airline customers to ""find an empty line and move through it!""  So we stopped to wait for an ""empty"" line as instructed, which there wasn't any.  Then he yelled ""what are you waiting for?  Keep moving!""  What a jerk!  I think people could have easily and intelligently moved along on their own without this guy's ""help!""  As soon as we went through the security area, the employees there were once again nice and helpful and even wished customers a good flight.  Our stress level finally lowered as we settled in to wait for our flight home.Unfortunately, that e-mail concerning my luggage refund never happened.....youtube.com/watch?v=LBiz…"
"So, I have been flying with American for at least 15 years. In fact, I've really focused on flying them as exclusively as possible. But my experiences at the Orlando airport (MCO) really left me lacking. I have platinum status, and had to catch an earlier flight. The earliest flight was departing 6am to LAX. I arrived at the airport at 4am. There were no people atriums, so I thought I would have a great chance at service. WRONG! I went to the ticket counter and asked about how I could be placed on standby from an earlier flight. I have her my record locator and my platform now m card. The person checking me in at the priority check in location was clueless, she was telling me I had to pay a $200 fee to change my flight. I know that was not true for same day standby. I informed her of that and she was confused. After we got this sorted, she said I didn't have a seat, that I had to go to the gate and check in with a gate agent. Great, I thought. Not great. All of the gates were deserted. Not a single worker around at 430am. So I went to Ky gate and waited. Innumerable people (at least 10) kept. Owning and using the terminals. Every person I asked, said they were not gate agents. Ok. They had AA pins on, not cabin crew (cause I asked). Baffling, right?! No, just laziness.Magically 3 of the same non-gate agents popped up and became the very same gate agents I was looking for over the past hour. Ok, I am pissed. Don't treat me like I'm stupid.I calmly walked over after these non-gate agents who had already helped a few people and asked about securing a seat. They informed me I was supposed to wait until they begin the boarding process. I asked when they thought that would be? They said we will make an announcement. As I walked away to the bathroom, they announced. Literally 30 seconds later. Grrrr. I went back to the counter and they said they had no seats. Of course I had platinum customer service on the phone, who confirmed to us (on speaker phone) there were 25 open seats. Again, magically. 25 seats popped up and were now visible to the gate agent. I mean seriously?! Needless to say, not a good experience and customer will hear about this. I have traveled all around the world with American and have NEVER been subjected to such incompetence by American personnel. Way too dismissive and lazy! I'm changing to Delta."
Dallas to Orlando flight 1669 today1 hour late leaving after boardingUpon arrival at Orlando an hour and 15 for luggage.....Never again .....
"American Airlines continues to fail. They fail not just in delivering the outcome they promise to fulfill by getting passengers to their destination when they they promised, but more importantly, they fail miserably at Customer Experience.Obsessing over providing an amazing Customer Experience is what Jeff Bezos built Amazon on, and today 72% of Americans turn to Amazon first when shopping for a product because they trust Amazon to provide a great shopping experience.American Airlines once again massively disappointed me again. This time they were rude to my wife and kids. Not cool.I'm a frequent flyer who never checks bags. For this trip, however, I was with my family and we had two extra bags full of Disney souvenirs to check. I went to go print our bag tags while my wife got in the long line that stretched outside the roped off Queue. The line for the check in kiosks was moving slower than the line to check bags. (Note...You're not allowed to get in line to check bags without printing your tags at the check in kiosks even if you've already checked in on your App).Here's where things got ridiculous. My wife and kids had made it all the way up to the start of the roped off Queue and were told they needed the tags on our bags before entering the Queue.I was literally ten feet away from the lady managing the Queue and made eye contact with her as my wife was pointing to me while I was printing out my two bag tags. The lady proceeded in telling my wife and kids to go to the back of the line. My wife didn't stand her ground while my last tag was printing out.I literally walked up as my wife was beginning to walk away and showed the lady my bag tags and asked to get back in the line. She had the audacity to tell me that it's an American Airlines policy to not let people in the Queue without their bag tags already printed.Another couple who had the same experience and were in line for the second time that morning let us get in front of them.At the end of the day, a policy that states ""customers who have bags to aren't allowed to stand in the line to check their bags unless they've already stood in another line to get a tag"" (this policy fails to keep ""Customer Experience"" top of mind...especially considering people are getting in line with the goal of getting help with their bags...the keyword there being ""Help"").At the end of the day, American Airlines is continuing to fail at providing an amazing customer experience. I was really hoping that this had changed from my last American Airlines review."
"This is by far the worst airline and flight I have ever been on. If I could have got off this plane right now I would. The experience is so bad that I'm writing this review while in the plane. The customer service is terrible, they have the worst attitude, and they are disrespectful.If I could have given them 0 stars I would do so.NEVER BOOKING THEM AGAIN!"
"Hmm...American....how once you were the ONLY way to fly....now....not so much.Why a 3 star review?  Cause their first class experience still is great.  How the layout and help getting around the airport?  Not quite.The ticket/gate agents were good, so the airport confusion was not their fault.Would I fly them again?  Sure, if it's first class.  Even checking the airport website last minute didn't help with the confusion."
"Diedra, you are an extremely rude, racist and condescending human being.  Your negative energy permeates the earth and makes the world a worst place to be.  Learn how to speak to people."
"These guys are incompetent!   How can you be the most experienced airline and be so miss managed?  From delays and cancellations to forced check of carry on bags when there is an ultra amount of space.   The attitude is only worse on Spirt Air.        They have truly lost sight of who there customer is......I had an isle seat.....and also force to change.   There is nothing they do right.....now as we prepare for take off I will keep my fingers cross that the pilots are better than the airport port staff.....As I post a two star review for at least having a seat, I have the sad realization that this will actually raise their score....."
"I have been a loyal customer of American Airlines for years. Yesterday one of my employees, Mr. Allan Paul Bruno, had a miserable experience with American, both my wife and I were with him in the Orlando Airport to witness the experience.We arrived early and tried to check-in at the kiosk for his flights from MCO to Manilla.  The kiosk wouldn't process the ticket and a gentleman came over and walked us to the re-booking area.  There we told his original flight was cancelled.  What?  We did not receive a phone call, text, or e-mail from American as we had purchased the ticket.  Always in the past we have received notification.Your agent, Yolanda, just shrugged and said he didn't know why we weren't notified.  Now over the next two (2 hours) we spent with Yolanda she was trying to re-book him.  Finally my wife looked the flights up on her phone and told Yolanda which flights to book.  Yolanda at some point asked Mr. Bruno if he spoke Spanish...he speaks fluent English, Tegalo and Malay...after she asked this it appeared to racial profiling.After 2 hours the flights were booked.  We asked about a voucher for him for his stay in Orlando...she printed it out and said...""I am not sure they will honor the voucher"".  What?  We stay at the same hotel often and know there staff, so there was no problem.  Now he has to eat?  She gave him an $11 voucher for dinner and breakfast that were only good in the airport.  I dare anyone to eat dinner and breakfast in the Orlando airport for $11.  Don't you think that this is ridiculous?He arrived this morning to check in assuming everything was OK.  Wrong!  Yolanda had not confirmed his flight from Hong Kong to Manilla.  Luckily the agent this morning made a phone call and accomplished this."
"What a bunch of morons, customer service to request a refund on a ticket due to a death in my family is like talking to a 2nd grader. They had to go back and forth with the supervisor, I provided all credentials to let them believe it is a legitimateexcuse and still they couldn't figure it out."
"Most Americans rarely fly, and their expectations are of a limousine quality experience.  However, they need to get a grip on reality, they are paying for a bus ride.I travel a lot for business.  As an Executive Platinum member, I always check in prior to arriving at the airport, enjoy the priority lane, get 2 free checked bags and am usually upgraded to first class.People need to realize that the flying once every 2 years, doesn't earn them any perks or privileges.Security in Orlando is always a mess - all of the families with screaming kids and grandma Moses in tow.  Being a ""known traveler"" guarantees me pre-check, so I can bypass the ding-dongs wearing all of the jewelry, steel toes boots, stuffed diaper bags, too many bottles, forgotten electronics and silver belt buckles.AA at Orlando is as efficient an operation as you'll find, with all of the ""infrequent travelers"" clogging things up."
"I am shocked to see so many bad reviews.  I have never had any problem with American Airlines.  I have noticed that ""Self check in"" has taken over for all of the airlines.  This last trip I messed up on my bags.  Was going to get into line and wait to fix it.  The attendant saw me and ask me what the problem was.  When I told him I have 3 bags for 3 people and hit the 1 button by mistake he took me over to the counter and had it fixed immediately.  No waiting in the long line.  THANK YOU!  I Also always prefer that the luggage is taken from me and placed behind there desk on the conveyor belt.  I do not like when some airlines want you to drop it off in a pile open to the public and one of two staff members put them on a separate scanner.  This seems like it is a set up for theft."
"This airline is a bit more expensive than most and is way less efficient. Getting baggage is a full task every time. There is no reason it should take 45 minutes to get your baggage after your flight lands. Also do not have enough workers. During both of my bag check ins there was only one worker on the outside check in, the line was extremely long bc inside line was long."
"Just a heads-up ...MCO ticket agents do not open up & start checking in passengers until about 3:30 am. This has been their habit for my last several trips. The TSA Pre line was open by the time I arrived at security, ~ at 3:45a. The tram from security to the gates has weird start times in the morning as well."
Another empty exit row(s).... smh when money for a cost of a seat is more than the cost of possible lives
"Baggage check agent was great.  Super polite and efficient.  Gate agents not so much.  I approached one that had nobody around them and was summarily ignored for several minute before they looked up and told me that they were busy finalizing a flight and wouldn't be able to help me.  Rude.  No power at the seats on the Airbus from SEA to CLT or from CLT to Orlando.  Not a great experience this entire trip.  I haven't flown American before this since the late 80's, and I don't plan on it again.  On the way from Seattle to Orlando my half hour layover in Charlotte involved four miles of running because they sent me to the wrong gate.  Not nearly as good as Delta or Alaska.  About the same as United."
I can't wait to get home to write my letter on how disappointing tnisglight was from MCO to PHX ( slept over nite in airport) to get to SFO with 2yrs old
"They are ALWAYS delayed! But they don't inform you of any issues or concerns until you are boarded! It is always something wrong! Either fuel gage issue,""mechanical maintenance issue"" or oxygen disconnecting issue.... blah blah blah! So far 4/4 of my flights have had delays! You would think they would know this before they have everyone board!! Not a dependable airline!!!"
"Talk about America's worst airline. If it weren't for the low rates American is pushing out through this Pandemic, they'd probably be out of business. They're filling up their planes, low cost style (spirit, frontier) so rarely respecting Covid-19 health standards, they do however give you a little sanitizing pack which is nice, will need it while I'm in my middle seat grasping for air under my facemask. American Airlines always has a ""maintenance"" issue, seriously they rarely leave on time so don't choose to fly them if you need to be somewhere at a certain time. Also, since their massive lay offs, you see these poor airport agents trying to do a million things at once while they try to start the boarding process (I'm sure the pay is not worth the stress). So sad! AA get your ish together, call up Delta and see what they're doing to keep it together during this pandemic. This airline is messy!"
"Whatever you do don't fly American Airlines. While waiting for my flight from MCO to DFW the airline made an announcement saying that anyone with a connecting flight in DFW would miss it due to the 2 hour maintenance delay we were experiencing for our flight out of MCO. American airlines then said everyone who missed their connecting flight due to the delay would be put in a hotel and given meal vouchers or they could wait 3 days for the next flight out since they were booked until then. So I get to Dallas thinking they were going to have a hotel for me for them to be like yeah sorry there isn't any vacancy in any of the hotels we work with so you are going to have to find your own hotel and pay for it and the transportation there and it had taken me 7 and a a half hours to get to this point and I was travelling with my cat and could not leave him in the carrier any longer so I had no choice but to find and pay for a hotel. The staff is extremely rude, incompetent, and unwilling to help. I will never fly American Airlines again I would rather rent a car and drive myself if they were the only flight available or wait until a different airline had something available. Save yourself time, money, and stress and pick a different airline."
"if i didn't have to get back to New York i'd give 0 stars because they are simply terrible. We paid for overpriced tickets (whatever) then they don't give us options for seating, so i assume the person im traveling with (fiancé) will be next to me. 6 days later we are heading back to New York and we get our boarding passes and find out we are in different aisles not near each other... Now we have to pay extra $$ to sit in the same row... Dumb how we 1- aren't informed about this prior to purchasing tickets 2- now charged $33 to sit next to each other on a non full plane... Then we get to terminal and hear a worker being rude to a person asking for information behind us. Also they have the wrong flight information up on the screen to confuse everybody having everyone ask for confirmation and they are annoyed about it... Well fix the screen info then! This is my first ever review and probably last. but had to inform people to never book with American Airlines."
"I boarded out of gate 58 at MCO international airport. When we started boarding yet once again was a big mess. First the disembarking of the plane was a big mess, where it took a long time to get the other people off. Next priority boarding everyone crowded around the gate. Next when we got to board our group group 5, people from group 6 when in the line. We boarded and once again the jetway was not level with the plane! Why can't American get that right? Next remember this plane is one of American's pretty new A321neo's! But now it took a long time to get out of the gate. Wired? So we got onto the runway and the left engine started several times. Everything was fine we were headed to LA and they said we will go up to Atlanta and then to LA. Next 10 minutes later they announced that oh one of the engines is not starting and we must go back to the gate and have them manually open and close it. Ok. Just remember I got up at 6:45 AM and got of a Disney Cruise,and have been waiting at MCO for this flight at 9 AM. Also my bag is checked in with American. My cousin was on a Delta flight from MCO to ATL and was stuck doing the same thing we are doing for 3 hours. At Least American has mood-lit planes this time. These planes are brand new though. Come on American! One of the people in first is traveling with a group of people in the first class too and said""I do driving for a living, I can rent a van and  drive to Los Angeles."" When we got back to the gate it was 6PM. We departed at 7 PM. Ok just saying I was at MCO airport for 10 hours. Before departing I found out that I think you can use the first class bathroom because the flight attendant said that it's ok to use the bathroom. Next after we departed finally I started using AA-Inflight WiFi because of the lack of IFE screens. This flight just like my first flight was at a different time then at purchase. The original flight was at 4:15 PM. After we got put on to the A321neo it was now 5:15 and we departed at 7PM. So the 4:15 to 5:15 if fine but departing on a almost brand new plan with about a 2 hour difference is no good. Also what is this:  Arrival Baggage Claim: T5C6Is my bag going to be in terminal 5? Just tell me what terminal and what number. American is the only airline is LAX T4. So if American labels the baggage clams like this, label them by number. Also looking  at aa.com it says that my flight is coming in about 1 hour 30 minutes late. Can the plane get worst? Yes, it can. So after flying the WiFi on the plane when down for about 5 minutes. This is my first flight that had problems with WiFi. Also is something different with the air in this plane? I have to drink about 1 and a half bottles of water for a 4 hour flight.  I finally landed in LAX 2 hours after my estimated arrival. I when to baggage Claim and T5C6 is in terminal 5. Also one of my bags I gate checked it and the claim stoped and then had 2 carts of luggage and it took about 30 for the hate checked bag"
"Thanks for ruining my trip back to philly with no compensation for my time, troubles, or inconvenience. Seems like when you billed my CC, things went smoothly. Also, saying my luggage will get there ""eventually"" doesn't make me wanna fly AA ever again....."
The check-in attended John was very helpful. The lady from Ecuador that push my wheelchair down to American airlines was wonderful they both helped me a lot and I'm very very pleased five stars to both
